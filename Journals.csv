"Tor [Dingledine et al. 2004] is the most widely used anonymity network today, serving millions of users on a daily basis using a growing number of volunteer-run routers. Since its deployment in 2003, there have been more than three dozen proposals that aim to improve its performance, security, and unobservability. Given the significance of this research area, our goal is to provide the reader with the state of current research directions and challenges in anonymous communication systems, focusing on the Tor network. We shed light on the design weaknesses and challenges facing the network and point out unresolved issues.","[Mashael Alsabah, Ian Goldberg]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Doha-Qatar, Canada]",21 September 2016,21,"[Qatar University and Qatar Computing Research Institute, Doha-Qatar, University of Waterloo, ON, Canada]",September,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Qatar University and Qatar Computing Research Institute, University of Waterloo]",ACM,2016,63ae010034ac983172e7ec77
"In the current hyperconnected era, modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people interact with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and participatory role. Such Human-Machine Networks (HMNs) are embedded in the daily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a significant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in designing successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in the same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, or following a wholly human-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary approach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many disciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical systems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social machines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans and machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing, crowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media, multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We systematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a focus on implications for designing HMNs. Moreover, we discuss risks associated with HMNs and identify emerging design and development trends.","[Milena Tsvetkova, Taha Yasseri, Eric T. Meyer, J.

"The Cloud computing paradigm has revolutionised the computer science horizon during the past decade and has enabled the emergence of computing as the fifth utility. It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.","[Rajkumar Buyya, Satish Narayana Srirama, Giuliano Casale, Rodrigo Calheiros, Yogesh Simmhan, Blesson Varghese]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Australia, Estonia, UK, Australia, India, UK]",19 November 2018,19,"[University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia, University of Tartu, Ulikooli, Tartu, Estonia, Imperial College London, Huxley, UK, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia, Indian Institute of Science, Nilgiri Marg, Mathikere, Bangalore, India, Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK]",November,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[University of Melbourne, University of Tartu, Imperial College London, Western Sydney University, Indian Institute of Science, Queen’s University Belfast]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7ec79
"Cyber attacks are increasingly menacing businesses. Based on the literature review and publicly available reports, this article conducts an extensive and consistent survey of the services used by the cybercrime business, organized using the value chain perspective, to understand cyber attack in a systematic way. Understanding the specialization, commercialization, and cooperation for cyber attacks helps us to identify 24 key value-added activities and their relations. These can be offered “as a service” for use in a cyber attack. This framework helps to understand the cybercriminal service ecosystem and hacking innovations. Finally, a few examples are provided showing how this framework can help to build a more cyber immune system, like targeting cybercrime control-points and assigning defense responsibilities to encourage collaboration.","[Keman Huang, Michael Siegel, Stuart Madnick]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[USA, USA, USA]",06 July 2018,6,"[Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA]",July,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7ec7a
"Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.","[Rui Zhang, Rui Xue, Ling Liu]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, China, GA]",03 July 2019,3,"[State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China and School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Haidian Dist, Beijing, China, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China and School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Haidian Dist, Beijing, China, School of Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA]",July,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[State Key Laboratory of Information Security, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, School of Computer Science]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ec7b

"Volunteer Computing is a kind of distributed computing that harnesses the aggregated spare computing resources of volunteer devices. It provides a cheaper and greener alternative computing infrastructure that can complement the dedicated, centralized, and expensive data centres. The aggregated idle computing resources of devices ranging from desktop computers to routers and smart TVs are being utilized to provide the much needed computing infrastructure for compute intensive tasks such as scientific simulations and big data analysis. However, the use of Volunteer Computing is still dominated by scientific applications and only a very small fraction of the potential volunteer nodes are participating. This article provides a comprehensive survey of Volunteer Computing, covering key technical and operational issues such as security, task distribution, resource management, and incentive models. The article also presents a taxonomy of Volunteer Computing systems, together with discussions of the characteristics of specific systems in each category. To harness the full potentials of Volunteer Computing and make it a reliable alternative computing infrastructure for general applications, we need to improve the existing techniques and device new mechanisms. Thus, this article also sheds light on important issues regarding the future research and development of Volunteer Computing systems with the aim of making them a viable alternative computing infrastructure.","[Tessema M.

"Autonomous systems will soon be integrating into our lives as home assistants, delivery drones, and driverless cars. The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the autonomy approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.","[Farha Jahan, Weiqing Sun, Quamar Niyaz, Mansoor Alam]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[OH, OH, IN, OH]",13 September 2019,13,"[University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, Purdue University Northwest, Hammond, IN, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH]",September,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[University of Toledo, University of Toledo, Purdue University Northwest, University of Toledo]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ec7f

"Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is recognized to be one of the most catastrophic attacks against various digital communication entities. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging technology for computer networks that uses open protocols for controlling switches and routers placed at the network edges by using specialized open programmable interfaces. In this article, a detailed study on DDoS threats prevalent in SDN is presented. First, SDN features are examined from the perspective of security, and then a discussion on SDN security features is done. Further, two viewpoints on protecting networks against DDoS attacks are presented. In the first view, SDN utilizes its abilities to secure conventional networks. In the second view, SDN may become a victim of the threat itself because of the centralized control mechanism. The main focus of this research work is on discovering critical security implications in SDN while reviewing the current ongoing research studies. By emphasizing the available state-of-the-art techniques, an extensive review of the advancement of SDN security is provided to the research and IT communities.","[Rochak Swami, Mayank Dave, Virender Ranga]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[India, India, India]",09 April 2019,9,"[National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India]",April,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[National Institute of Technology, National Institute of Technology, National Institute of Technology]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ec82
"Online Social Networks (OSNs) incorporate different forms of interactive communication, including microblogging services, multimedia sharing, business networking, and so on. They allow users to create profiles, connect with friends, and share their daily activities and thoughts. However, this ease of use of OSNs comes with a cost in terms of users’ privacy and security. The big amount of personal data shared in the users’ profiles or correlated from their activities can be stored, processed, and sold for advertisement or statistical purposes. It attracts also malicious users who can collect and exploit the data and target different types of attacks. In this article, we review the state of the art of OSNs existing either in the literature or deployed for use. We focus on the OSN systems that offer, but not exclusively, microblogging services. We analyze and evaluate each system based on a set of characteristics, and we compare them based on their usability and the level of protection of privacy and security they provide.

"This article provides a systematic review of cloud pricing in an interdisciplinary approach. It examines many historical cases of pricing in practice and tracks down multiple roots of pricing in research. The aim is to help both cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud customers to capture the essence of cloud pricing when they need to make a critical decision either to achieve competitive advantages or to manage cloud resource effectively. Currently, the number of available pricing schemes in the cloud market is overwhelming. It is an intricate issue to understand these schemes and associated pricing models clearly due to involving several domains of knowledge, such as cloud technologies, microeconomics, operations research, and value theory. Some earlier studies have introduced this topic unsystematically. Their approaches inevitably lead to much confusion for many cloud decision-makers. To address their weaknesses, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of cloud pricing, which is driven by a framework of three fundamental pricing strategies that are built on nine cloud pricing categories. These categories can be further mapped onto a total of 60 pricing models. Many of the pricing models have been already adopted by CSPs. Others have been widespread across in other industries. We give descriptions of these model categories and highlight both advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, this article offers an extensive survey of many cloud pricing models that were proposed by many researchers during the past decade. Based on the survey, we identify four trends of cloud pricing and the general direction, which is moving from intrinsic value per physical box to extrinsic value per serverless sandbox. We conclude that hyper-converged cloud resources pool supported by cloud orchestration, virtual machine, Open Application Programming Interface, and serverless sandbox will drive the future of cloud pricing.","[Caesar Wu, Rajkumar Buyya, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Australia, Australia, Australia]",16 October 2019,16,"[Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Lab, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia, Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Lab, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia, Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Lab, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia]",October,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Lab, Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Lab, Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Lab]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ec85

"Security and privacy of users have become significant concerns due to the involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in numerous applications. Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain.

"When developing peer-to-peer applications on distributed ledger technology (DLT), a crucial decision is the selection of a suitable DLT design (e.g., Ethereum), because it is hard to change the underlying DLT design post hoc. To facilitate the selection of suitable DLT designs, we review DLT characteristics and identify trade-offs between them. Furthermore, we assess how DLT designs account for these trade-offs and we develop archetypes for DLT designs that cater to specific requirements of applications on DLT. The main purpose of our article is to introduce scientific and practical audiences to the intricacies of DLT designs and to support development of viable applications on DLT.","[Niclas Kannengießer, Sebastian Lins, Tobias Dehling, Ali Sunyaev]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Germany, Germany, Germany, Germany]",29 May 2020,29,"[Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Blockchain Center EU, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany, Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany]",May,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods, Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods, Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods, Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ec8d
"Blockchain technology is believed by many to be a game changer in many application domains. While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing—Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.","[Huashan Chen, Marcus Pendleton, Laurent Njilla, Shouhuai Xu]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[USA, , , USA]",12 June 2020,12,"[The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and 90 COS/CYD, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA]",June,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[The University of Texas at San Antonio, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and 90 COS/CYD, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at San Antonio]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ec8e
"Software-defined networks offer flexible and intelligent network operations by splitting a traditional network into a centralized control plane and a programmable data plane. The controller in the control plane is the fundamental element used to manage all operations of the data plane. Hence, the performance and capabilities of the controller itself are essential in achieving optimal performance. Furthermore, the tools used to benchmark their performance must be accurate and useful in measuring different evaluation parameters. There are dozens of controller proposals for general and specialized networks in the literature. However, there is a very limited comprehensive quantitative analysis for them. In this article, we present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of different SDN controllers, along with a quantitative analysis of their performance in different network scenarios. We categorize and classify 34 controllers and present a qualitative comparison. We also present a comparative analysis of controllers for specialized networks such as the Internet of Things, blockchain networks, vehicular networks, and wireless sensor networks. We also discuss in-depth capabilities of benchmarking tools and provide a comparative analysis of their capabilities.

"Decentralized trust management is used as a referral benchmark for assisting decision making by human or intelligence machines in open collaborative systems. During any given period of time, each participant may only interact with a few other participants. Simply relying on direct trust may frequently resort to random team formation. Thus, trust aggregation becomes critical. It can leverage decentralized trust management to learn about indirect trust of every participant based on past transaction experiences. This article presents alternative designs of decentralized trust management and their efficiency and robustness from three perspectives. First, we study the risk factors and adverse effects of six common threat models. Second, we review the representative trust aggregation models and trust metrics. Third, we present an in-depth analysis and comparison of these reference trust aggregation methods with respect to effectiveness and robustness. We show our comparative study results through formal analysis and experimental evaluation.

"Cryptographic algorithms have been used not only to create robust ciphertexts but also to generate cryptograms that, contrary to the classic goal of cryptography, are meant to be broken. These cryptograms, generally called puzzles, require the use of a certain amount of resources to be solved, hence introducing a cost that is often regarded as a time delay—though it could involve other metrics as well, such as bandwidth. These powerful features have made puzzles the core of many security protocols, acquiring increasing importance in the IT security landscape. The concept of a puzzle has subsequently been extended to other types of schemes that do not use cryptographic functions, such as CAPTCHAs, which are used to discriminate humans from machines. Overall, puzzles have experienced a renewed interest with the advent of Bitcoin, which uses a CPU-intensive puzzle as proof of work. In this article, we provide a comprehensive study of the most important puzzle construction schemes available in the literature, categorizing them according to several attributes, such as resource type, verification type, and applications. We have redefined the term puzzle by collecting and integrating the scattered notions used in different works, to cover all the existing applications. Moreover, we provide an overview of the possible applications, identifying key requirements and different design approaches. Finally, we highlight the features and limitations of each approach, providing a useful guide for the future development of new puzzle schemes.","[Isra Mohamed Ali, Maurantonio Caprolu, Roberto Di Pietro]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Qatar, Qatar, Qatar]",20 August 2020,20,"[Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), College of Science and Engineering (CSE), Division of Information and Computing Technology (ICT), Doha, Qatar, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), College of Science and Engineering (CSE), Division of Information and Computing Technology (ICT), Doha, Qatar, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), College of Science and Engineering (CSE), Division of Information and Computing Technology (ICT), Doha, Qatar]",August,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU)]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ec93

"The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven paradigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as the increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and consume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs.

"Voting is a formal expression of opinion or choice, either positive or negative, made by an individual or a group of individuals. However, conventional voting systems tend to be centralized, which are known to suffer from security and efficiency limitations.

The latter is a decentralized digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network, where a copy of the append-only ledger of digitally signed and encrypted transactions is maintained by each participant. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of blockchain-based voting systems and classify them based on a number of features (e.g., the types of blockchain used, the consensus approaches used, and the scale of participants). By systematically analyzing and comparing the different blockchain-based voting systems, we also identify a number of limitations and research opportunities.

"Unprecedented attention towards blockchain technology is serving as a game-changer in fostering the development of blockchain-enabled distinctive frameworks. However, fragmentation unleashed by its underlying concepts hinders different stakeholders from effectively utilizing blockchain-supported services, resulting in the obstruction of its wide-scale adoption. To explore synergies among the isolated frameworks requires comprehensively studying inter-blockchain communication approaches. These approaches broadly come under the umbrella of Blockchain Interoperability (BI) notion, as it can facilitate a novel paradigm of an integrated blockchain ecosystem that connects state-of-the-art disparate blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of studies that comprehensively review BI, which works as a stumbling block in its development. Therefore, this article aims to articulate potential of BI by reviewing it from diverse perspectives. Beginning with a glance of blockchain architecture fundamentals, this article discusses its associated platforms, taxonomy, and consensus mechanisms. Subsequently, it argues about BI’s requirement by exemplifying its potential opportunities and application areas. Concerning BI, an architecture seems to be a missing link. Hence, this article introduces a layered architecture for the effective development of protocols and methods for interoperable blockchains. Furthermore, this article proposes an in-depth BI research taxonomy and provides an insight into the state-of-the-art projects.

"Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has attracted the attention of the scientific community and companies, as proven by the exponential growth of publications on this topic in recent years. This growing interest is mainly due to the promise that the use of blockchain enables it to be verified, without including any trusted intermediaries, that the information received from the network is authentic and up-to-date. In this respect, blockchain is a distributed database that can be seen as a ledger that records all transactions that have ever been executed. In this context, smart contracts are pieces of software used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a transaction on a blockchain platform. These pieces of software are implemented by using programming languages, which are sometimes provided by the blockchain platforms themselves. This study aims to (1) identify and categorise the state-of-the-art related to smart contract languages, in terms of the existing languages and their main features, and (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a multivocal mapping study that follows the guidelines proposed by Garousi et al. for conducting multivocal literature reviews, as well as the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for conducting mapping studies. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 4,119 papers were gathered, and 109 of them were selected for extraction. The contributions of this article are twofold: (1) 101 different smart contract languages have been identified and classified according to a variety of criteria; (2) a discussion on the findings and their implications for future research have been outlined. As a conclusion, it could be stated that a rigorous and replicable overview of the state-of-the-art of smart contract languages has been provided that can benefit not only researchers but also practitioners in the field, thanks to its multivocal nature.","[Ángel Jesús Varela-Vaca, Antonia M.

"A smart contract is a computer program that allows users to automate their actions on the blockchain platform. Given the significance of smart contracts in supporting important activities across industry sectors including supply chain, finance, legal, and medical services, there is a strong demand for verification and validation techniques.

"Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state-machine replication makes it possible to design systems that are resilient against arbitrary faults, a requirement considered crucial for an increasing number of use cases such as permissioned blockchains, firewalls, and SCADA systems. Unfortunately, the strong fault-tolerance guarantees provided by BFT replication protocols come at the cost of a high complexity, which is why it is inherently difficult to correctly implement BFT systems in practice. This is all the more true with regard to the plethora of solutions and ideas that have been developed in recent years to improve performance, availability, or resource efficiency. This survey aims at facilitating the task of building BFT systems by presenting an overview of state-of-the-art techniques and analyzing their practical implications, for example, with respect to applicability and composability. In particular, this includes problems that arise in the context of concrete implementations, but which are often times passed over in literature.

Among the vast array of security issues plaguing the emerging IoT, we decide to focus on access control, as privacy, trust, and other security properties cannot be achieved without controlled access. This article classifies IoT access control solutions from the literature according to their architecture (e.g., centralized, hierarchical, federated, distributed) and examines the suitability of each one for access control purposes. Our analysis concludes that important properties such as auditability and revocation are missing from many proposals while hierarchical and federated architectures are neglected by the community.

"Despite the rapid growth and advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT), there are critical challenges that need to be addressed before the full adoption of the IoT. Data privacy is one of the hurdles towards the adoption of IoT as there might be potential misuse of users’ data and their identity in IoT applications.

However, most of the existing solutions still suffer from various drawbacks, such as huge bandwidth utilization and network latency, heavyweight cryptosystems, and policies that are applied on sensor devices and in the cloud. To address these issues, fog computing has been introduced for IoT network edges providing low latency, computation, and storage services. In this survey, we comprehensively review and classify privacy requirements for an in-depth understanding of privacy implications in IoT applications.

Due to the software bugs in applications and existing vulnerabilities such as illegal function calling, resource exhaustion, lack of trust, and so on, NBIs are susceptible to different attacks.

"Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has recently emerged as a prominent candidate for the Future Internet Architecture (FIA) that addresses existing issues with the host-centric communication model of the current TCP/IP-based Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN architectures that provides a clean-slate approach for Internet communication. NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to the content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects, Access Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular content. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive communication and decouple the content from its original location. This phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content, causing different challenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date, considerable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In this article, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first summarize the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to content-based security, and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in NDN. We then classify the existing AC mechanisms into two main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent AC. Each category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g., Attribute-based AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC). Finally, we present the lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges of NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research directions for the community.","[Boubakr Nour, Hakima Khelifi, Rasheed Hussain, Spyridon Mastorakis]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, China, Russia, USA]",17 April 2021,17,"[Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, Innopolis University, Innopolis, Russia, University of Nebraska Omaha, Omaha, NE, USA]",April,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Innopolis University, University of Nebraska Omaha]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7eca8

"Resource-constrained IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, have become ubiquitous in recent years. This has led to the generation of large quantities of data in real-time, which is an appealing target for AI systems. However, deploying machine learning models on such end-devices is nearly impossible. A typical solution involves offloading data to external computing systems (such as cloud servers) for further processing but this worsens latency, leads to increased communication costs, and adds to privacy concerns. To address this issue, efforts have been made to place additional computing devices at the edge of the network, i.e., close to the IoT devices where the data is generated. Deploying machine learning systems on such edge computing devices alleviates the above issues by allowing computations to be performed close to the data sources.

"As connectivity between and within vehicles increases, so does concern about safety and security. Various automotive serial protocols are used inside vehicles such as Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN), and FlexRay. CAN Bus is the most used in-vehicle network protocol to support exchange of vehicle parameters between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This protocol lacks security mechanisms by design and is therefore vulnerable to various attacks. Furthermore, connectivity of vehicles has made the CAN Bus vulnerable not only from within the vehicle but also from outside. With the rise of connected cars, more entry points and interfaces have been introduced on board vehicles, thereby also leading to a wider potential attack surface. Existing security mechanisms focus on the use of encryption, authentication, and vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which operate under various constraints such as low bandwidth, small frame size (e.g., in the CAN protocol), limited availability of computational resources, and real-time sensitivity. We survey and classify current cryptographic and IDS approaches and compare these approaches based on criteria such as real-time constraints, types of hardware used, changes in CAN Bus behaviour, types of attack mitigation, and software/ hardware used to validate these approaches.

"In recent years, mobile devices have gained increasing development with stronger computation capability and larger storage space. Some of the computation-intensive machine learning tasks can now be run on mobile devices. To exploit the resources available on mobile devices and preserve personal privacy, the concept of client-based machine learning has been proposed. It leverages the users’ local hardware and local data to solve machine learning sub-problems on mobile devices and only uploads computation results rather than the original data for the optimization of the global model. Such an architecture can not only relieve computation and storage burdens on servers but also protect the users’ sensitive information. Another benefit is the bandwidth reduction because various kinds of local data can be involved in the training process without being uploaded.

Common use cases of randomness range from low-level packet transmission to advanced algorithms of artificial intelligence as well as security and trust, which heavily rely on unpredictable random sources.

"Decentralised learning is attracting more and more interest because it embodies the principles of data minimisation and focused data collection, while favouring the transparency of purpose specification (i.e., the objective for which a model is built). Cloud-centric-only processing and deep learning are no longer strict necessities to train high-fidelity models; edge devices can actively participate in the decentralised learning process by exchanging meta-level information in place of raw data, thus paving the way for better privacy guarantees. In addition, these new possibilities can relieve the network backbone from unnecessary data transfer and allow it to meet strict low-latency requirements by leveraging on-device model inference. This survey provides a detailed and up-to-date overview of the most recent contributions available in the state-of-the-art decentralised learning literature. In particular, it originally provides the reader audience with a clear presentation of the peculiarities of federated settings, with a novel taxonomy of decentralised learning approaches, and with a detailed description of the most relevant and specific system-level contributions of the surveyed solutions for privacy, communication efficiency, non-IIDness, device heterogeneity, and poisoning defense.","[Paolo Bellavista, Luca Foschini, Alessio Mora]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Italy, Italy, Italy]",11 February 2021,11,"[University of Bologna, Italy, University of Bologna, Italy, University of Bologna, Italy]",February,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Bologna, University of Bologna, University of Bologna]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ecb5
"Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystems tend to grow both in scale and complexity, as they consist of a variety of heterogeneous devices that span over multiple architectural IoT layers (e.g., cloud, edge, sensors). Further, IoT systems increasingly demand the resilient operability of services, as they become part of critical infrastructures. This leads to a broad variety of research works that aim to increase the resilience of these systems. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making IoT systems resilient. In particular, we first discuss the taxonomy and classification of resilience and resilience mechanisms and subsequently survey state-of-the-art resilience mechanisms that have been proposed by research work and are applicable to IoT.

"A blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology where transactions as data state changes are permanently recorded securely and transparently without the need for third parties. Besides, introducing smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability, revolutionizing the software ecosystem toward decentralized applications (DApps). Although promising, the usability of smart contracts is primarily limited to on-chain data without access to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events reside. This connectability to off-chain data for smart contracts and blockchain is an open practical problem referred to as the “oracle problem” and is defined as how real-world data can be transferred into/from the blockchain. Hence, Blockchain oracles are introduced and implemented in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs) connecting the real world to the blockchain for mitigating such a limitation. This paper studies and analyzes how blockchain oracles provide final feedback (i.e., outcome) to smart contracts and survey blockchain oracle technologies and mechanisms regarding data integrity and correctness. Since the existing solutions are extensive in terms of characteristics and usage, we investigate their structure and principles by classifying the blockchain oracle implementation techniques into two major groups voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on participants’ stakes for outcome finalization, while the latter considers reputation and performance metrics in conjunction with authenticity-proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We present the result of this classification with a thorough discussion of the state-of-the-art and provide the remaining challenges and future research directions in the end.","[Amirmohammad Pasdar, Young Choon Lee, Zhongli Dong]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Australia, Australia]",20 October 2022,20,"[School of Computing, Macquarie University, Australia, Aglive Pty Ltd, Australia]",October,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[School of Computing, Aglive Pty Ltd]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecb7
"Federated learning (FL) has experienced a boom in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck, while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios. Blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of FL from various perspectives. In this survey, we will comprehensively summarize and evaluate existing variants of blockchain-enabled FL, identify the emerging challenges, and propose potentially promising research directions in this under-explored domain.","[Youyang Qu, Md Palash Uddin, Chenquan Gan, Yong Xiang, Longxiang Gao, John Yearwood]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Australia, Australia, China, Australia, China, Australia]",21 November 2022,21,"[Data61, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia, School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Australia, School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Australia, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), and Shandong Computer Science Center (National Supercomputer Center in Jinan), China, School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Australia]",November,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Data61, School of Information Technology, School of Communication and Information Engineering, School of Information Technology, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), School of Information Technology]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecb8
"Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs.

"In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On the one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms, and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals.

"The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.","[Omar Hasan, Lionel Brunie, Elisa Bertino]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[France, France, IN]",18 January 2022,18,"[University of Lyon, CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, France, University of Lyon, CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, France, Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, IN]",January,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[University of Lyon, University of Lyon, Department of Computer Science]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecbc
"The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem connects physical devices to the internet, offering significant advantages in agility, responsiveness and potential environmental benefits. The number and variety of IoT devices are sharply increasing, and as they do, they generate significant data sources. Deep learning algorithms are increasingly integrated into IoT applications to learn and infer patterns and make intelligent decisions. However, current IoT paradigms rely on centralised storage and computing to operate the deep learning algorithms. This key central component can potentially cause issues in scalability, security threats and privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for deep learning algorithms to preserve data privacy. Although FL helps reduce privacy leakage by avoiding transferring client data, it still has many challenges related to models’ vulnerabilities and attacks. With the emergence of blockchain and smart contracts, the utilisation of these technologies has the potential to safeguard FL across IoT ecosystems. This study aims to review blockchain-based FL methods for securing IoT systems holistically. It presents the current state of research in blockchain, how it can be applied to FL approaches, current IoT security issues and responses to outline the need to use emerging approaches toward the security and privacy of IoT ecosystems. It also focuses on IoT data analytics from a security perspective and the open research questions.

"Limitations on high latency and low scalability of classical blockchain systems retard their adoptions and applications.

These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently rebuild upper layer components. The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises DAG techniques. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of ever-existing and ongoing DAG-based blockchain systems.

"Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple edge devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, which means a trustworthy central authority is needed which has disadvantages, including vulnerable to attacks, not always credible, and hard to calculate rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the problems mentioned above. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods as well as techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning.

Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes, namely decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated.

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world’s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.","[Linghe Kong, Jinlin Tan, Junqin Huang, Guihai Chen, Shuaitian Wang, Xi Jin, Peng Zeng]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China, China, China]",23 December 2022,23,"[Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, China, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chuangxin Road, Hunnan District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, China, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chuangxin Road, Hunnan District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, China]",December,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Shenyang Institute of Automation]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecc8

"Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence (C3I) systems are increasingly used in critical civil and military domains for achieving information superiority, operational efficacy, and greater situational awareness. The critical civil and military domains include, but are not limited to battlefield, healthcare, transportation, and rescue missions. Given the sensitive nature and modernization of tactical domains, the security of C3I systems has recently become a critical concern. This is because cyber-attacks on C3I systems have catastrophic consequences including loss of human lives. Despite the increasing number of cyber-attacks on C3I systems and growing concerns about C3I systems’ security, there is a paucity of a comprehensive review to systematize the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. Therefore, in this paper, we have gathered, analyzed, and synthesized the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. We have identified and reported security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures/defenses for C3I systems. In particular, this paper has enabled us to (i) propose a taxonomy for security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures; (ii) interrelate attack vectors with security vulnerabilities and countermeasures; and (iii) propose future research directions for advancing the state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems. We believe that our findings will serve as a guideline for practitioners and researchers to advance the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems.","[Hussain Ahmad, Isuru Dharmadasa, Faheem Ullah, M.

"Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) are effectively utilized in various complicated challenges in healthcare, industry, and academia. The Internet of Drones (IoD) has lately cropped up due to high adjustability to a broad range of unpredictable circumstances. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be utilized efficiently in a multitude of scenarios, including rescue missions and search, farming, mission-critical services, surveillance systems, and so on, owing to technical and realistic benefits such as low movement, the capacity to lengthen wireless coverage zones, and the ability to attain places unreachable to human beings. In many studies, IoD and UAV are utilized interchangeably. Besides, drones enhance the efficiency aspects of various network topologies, including delay, throughput, interconnectivity, and dependability. Nonetheless, the deployment of drone systems raises various challenges relating to the inherent unpredictability of the wireless medium, the high mobility degrees, and the battery life that could result in rapid topological changes. In this paper, the IoD is originally explained in terms of potential applications and comparative operational scenarios. Then, we classify ML in the IoD-UAV world according to its applications, including resource management, surveillance and monitoring, object detection, power control, energy management, mobility management, and security management. This research aims to supply the readers with a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of IoD/UAV, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that need further investigation and consideration. The results suggest that the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method is the most often employed ML method in publications.

"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming one of the main technological supports for commercial applications, embracing many domains ranging from human safety to the medical field, agriculture and environment, multimedia production, and even commercial delivery. This rise in popularity, however, is causing an increasing interest from criminals, making UAVs the target of new attacks. To fully characterize the current UAV cybersecurity landscape, we perform a complete literature review, digging into drone security historic facts and scientific studies on the matter, reviewing specialized articles and scientific papers focusing on cybersecurity threats and gaps in the context of small UAVs in commercial applications. Being a recent research and development area, most of the articles have been published between 2016 and 2020 as a direct consequence of the increase of security concerns and interest in the drone field. Papers in this review deal with UAV cyberthreats and related vulnerabilities, identifying flaws experimented in a lab or describing incidents detected in the field. Communication, sensors, and system misconfigurations are among the most important threat vectors, while sensor spoofing/jamming and malware DoS/control are among the most cited threats. Threat vectors permit depicting a complete overview of the topic and potential countermeasures known to date, with related gap analysis, also accounting for the recent Unmanned Aircraft System evolution toward ad hoc or cloud-based UAV networks. Countermeasures include the adoption of traditional communication encryption and standard protocols, GPS spoofing/jamming mitigation, encryption and privacy-aware implementations, and counter-malware techniques, to name the most adopted. It also emerges that often attacks are simply ported or adapted from other attacks in similar domains, while peculiar attacks still remain such as targeted physical attacks, specific UAV malware, and GPS spoofing/jamming.","[Alessio Rugo, Claudio A.

"Owing to the advancements in communication and computation technologies, the dream of commercialized connected and autonomous cars is becoming a reality. However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication.

"Recent years have witnessed the widespread popularity of Internet of things (IoT). By providing sufficient data for model training and inference, IoT has promoted the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to a great extent. Under this background and trend, the traditional cloud computing model may nevertheless encounter many problems in independently tackling the massive data generated by IoT and meeting corresponding practical needs. In response, a new computing model called edge computing (EC) has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. With the continuous deepening of the research on EC, however, scholars have found that traditional (non-AI) methods have their limitations in enhancing the performance of EC. Seeing the successful application of AI in various fields, EC researchers start to set their sights on AI, especially from a perspective of machine learning (ML), a branch of AI which has gained increased popularity in the past decades. In this paper, we first explain the formal definition of EC and the reasons why EC has become a favorable computing model. Then, we discuss the problems of interest in EC. We summarize the traditional solutions and hightlight their limitations. By explaining the research results of using AI to optimize EC and applying AI to other fields under the EC architecture, this paper can serve as a guide to explore new research ideas in these two aspects while enjoying the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and EC.","[Haochen Hua, Yutong Li, Tonghe Wang, Nanqing Dong, Wei Li, Junwei Cao]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[P.

"With the development of real-time critical systems, the ever-increasing communication data traffic puts forward high-bandwidth and low-delay requirements for communication networks. Therefore, various real-time Ethernet protocols have been proposed, but these protocols are not compatible with each other. The IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed standardized protocols named Audio Video Bridging (AVB) in 2005, and renamed it Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) later. TSN not only adds new features but also retains the original functions of AVB. Proposing real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies is the key to meeting high-bandwidth and low-delay communication requirements. This article surveys the modeling from AVB to TSN, mainly including: (1) AVB and TSN modeling; (2) end-to-end delay modeling; (3) real-time scheduling modeling; (4) reliability modeling; and (5) security modeling. Based on these models, this article surveys the recent advances in real-time Ethernet design methodologies from AVB to TSN: (1) end-to-end delay analysis from AVB to TSN; (2) real-time scheduling from AVB to TSN; (3) reliability-aware design for TSN; and (4) security-aware design for TSN. Among the above four points, the last two points are only for TSN, because AVB lacks reliability and security mechanisms. This article further takes the automotive use case as an example to discuss the application of TSN in automobiles. Finally, this article discusses the future trends of TSN. By surveying the recent advances and future trends, we hope to provide references for researchers interested in real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies for AVB and TSN.","[Libing Deng, Guoqi Xie, Hong Liu, Yunbo Han, Renfa Li, Keqin Li]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China, New Paltz]",18 January 2022,18,"[Hunan University, Changsha, China, Hunan University, Changsha, China, Shanghai Trusted Industrial Control Platform Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China, Tencent CSIG, Shenzhen, China, Hunan University, Changsha, China, State University of New York, New Paltz]",January,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Hunan University, Hunan University, Shanghai Trusted Industrial Control Platform Co., Tencent CSIG, Hunan University, State University of New York]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecd5

We conclude by observing the evolutionary paradigm-shift that has taken place from pure single-component bandwidth-efficiency, power-efficiency or delay-optimization towards multi-component designs, as exemplified by the twin-component ultra-reliable low-latency mode of the 5G system. We advocate a further evolutionary step towards multi-component Pareto optimization, which requires the exploration of the entire Pareto front of all optiomal solutions, where none of the components of the objective function may be improved without degrading at least one of the other components.","[Li-Hsiang Shen, Kai-Ten Feng, Lajos Hanzo]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Taiwan, U.K.]",22 November 2022,22,"[Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, U.K.]",November,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Department of Electronics and Computer Science]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecd9
"Image sharing on online social networks (OSNs) has become an indispensable part of daily social activities, but it has also increased the risk of privacy invasion. An online image can reveal various types of sensitive information, prompting the public to rethink individual privacy needs in OSN image sharing critically. However, the interaction of images and OSN makes the privacy issues significantly complicated. The current real-world solutions for privacy management fail to provide adequate personalized, accurate, and flexible privacy protection. Constructing a more intelligent environment for privacy-friendly OSN image sharing is urgent in the near future. Meanwhile, given the dynamics in both users’ privacy needs and OSN context, a comprehensive understanding of OSN image privacy throughout the entire sharing process is preferable to any views from a single side, dimension, or level. To fill this gap, we contribute a survey of “privacy intelligence” that targets modern privacy issues in dynamic OSN image sharing from a user-centric perspective. Specifically, we present the important properties and a taxonomy of OSN image privacy, along with a high-level privacy analysis framework based on the lifecycle of OSN image sharing. The framework consists of three stages with different principles of privacy by design. At each stage, we identify typical user behaviors in OSN image sharing and their associated privacy issues. Then a systematic review of representative intelligent solutions to those privacy issues is conducted, also in a stage-based manner. The analysis results in an intelligent “privacy firewall” for closed-loop privacy management. Challenges and future directions in this area are also discussed.","[Chi Liu, Tianqing Zhu, Jun Zhang, Wanlei Zhou]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Australia, Australia, Australia, China]",23 December 2022,23,"[University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia, Swinburne University of Technology, Sydney, VIC, Australia, City University of Macau, Macau SAR, China]",December,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[University of Technology Sydney, University of Technology Sydney, Swinburne University of Technology, City University of Macau]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecda
"Constructing energy-efficient database systems to reduce economic costs and environmental impact has been studied for 10 years. With the emergence of the big data age, along with the data-centric and data-intensive computing trend, the great amount of energy consumed by database systems has become a major concern in a society that pursues Green IT. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this matter in Green IT, there have been few comprehensive or systematic studies conducted in this field. Therefore, the objective of this article is to present a literature survey with breadth and depth on existing energy management techniques for database systems. The existing literature is organized hierarchically with two major branches focusing separately on energy consumption models and energy-saving techniques. Under each branch, we first introduce some basic knowledge, then we classify, discuss, and compare existing research according to their core ideas, basic approaches, and main characteristics. Finally, based on these observations through our study, we identify multiple open issues and challenges, and provide insights for future research. It is our hope that our outcome of this work will help researchers develop more energy-efficient database systems.","[Binglei Guo, Jiong Yu, Dexian Yang, Hongyong Leng, Bin Liao]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[P.R.

"The prosperity of machine learning has been accompanied by increasing attacks on the training process. Among them, poisoning attacks have become an emerging threat during model training. Poisoning attacks have profound impacts on the target models, e.g., making them unable to converge or manipulating their prediction results. Moreover, the rapid development of recent distributed learning frameworks, especially federated learning, has further stimulated the development of poisoning attacks. Defending against poisoning attacks is challenging and urgent. However, the systematic review from a unified perspective remains blank. This survey provides an in-depth and up-to-date overview of poisoning attacks and corresponding countermeasures in both centralized and federated learning. We firstly categorize attack methods based on their goals. Secondly, we offer detailed analysis of the differences and connections among the attack techniques. Furthermore, we present countermeasures in different learning framework and highlight their advantages and disadvantages.

With the increasing demand of society and the continuous progress of technologies, UAV communication networks (UAVCN) are also flourishing. The mobility of UAV nodes allows for flexible network deployment, but some challenges are brought, such as power constraints, throughput, cost, and time efficiency. Therefore, path planning is significant for UAVCN. This paper presents a review of UAVCN path planning. We first introduce the network structure and performance evaluation of UAVCN. We then investigate the generic UAV path planning algorithms and the path planning algorithms in UAVCN. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of each path planning algorithm and the functional problems. The challenges faced in path planning for UAVCN, the solutions, state-of-the-art, and representative results are also presented.

"In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end-users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial losses of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, and is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.","[Harun Oz, Ahmet Aris, Albert Levi, A.

"Despite its technological benefits, the Internet of Things (IoT) has cyber weaknesses due to vulnerabilities in the wireless medium. Machine Larning (ML)-based methods are widely used against cyber threats in IoT networks with promising performance. An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is prominent for cybercriminals to compromise networks, and it is crucial to long-term and harmful characteristics. However, it is difficult to apply ML-based approaches to identify APT attacks to obtain a promising detection performance due to an extremely small percentage among normal traffic. There are limited surveys that fully investigate APT attacks in IoT networks due to the lack of public datasets with all types of APT attacks. It is worth bridging the state of the art in network attack detection with APT attack detection in a comprehensive review article. This survey article reviews the security challenges in IoT networks and presents well-known attacks, APT attacks, and threat models in IoT systems. Meanwhile, signature-based, anomaly-based, and hybrid intrusion detection systems are summarized for IoT networks.

"Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) cannot cope with the increasing number and sophistication of cyberattacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Due to their high false-positive rate and the required effort of security experts to validate them, incidents can remain undetected for up to several months. As a result, enterprises suffer from data loss and severe financial damage. Recent research explored data provenance for Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) as one promising data source to tackle this issue. Data provenance represents information flows between system entities as Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG). Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS) utilize data provenance to enhance the detection performance of intrusions and reduce false-alarm rates compared to traditional IDS. This survey demonstrates the potential of PIDS by providing a detailed evaluation of recent research in the field, proposing a novel taxonomy for PIDS, discussing current issues, and potential future research directions. This survey aims to help and motivate researchers to get started in the field of PIDS by tackling issues of data collection, graph summarization, intrusion detection, and developing real-world benchmark datasets.","[Michael Zipperle, Florian Gottwalt, Elizabeth Chang, Tharam Dillon]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[Australia, Australia, Australia, Australia]",15 December 2022,15,"[University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia and Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre, Australia, University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia]",December,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[University of New South Wales, University of New South Wales, Griffith University, La Trobe University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ece3
"Fuzz testing (fuzzing) has witnessed its prosperity in detecting security flaws recently. It generates a large number of test cases and monitors the executions for defects. Fuzzing has detected thousands of bugs and vulnerabilities in various applications. Although effective, there lacks systematic analysis of gaps faced by fuzzing. As a technique of defect detection, fuzzing is required to narrow down the gaps between the entire input space and the defect space. Without limitation on the generated inputs, the input space is infinite. However, defects are sparse in an application, which indicates that the defect space is much smaller than the entire input space. Besides, because fuzzing generates numerous test cases to repeatedly examine targets, it requires fuzzing to perform in an automatic manner. Due to the complexity of applications and defects, it is challenging to automatize the execution of diverse applications. In this article, we systematically review and analyze the gaps as well as their solutions, considering both breadth and depth.

"Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) manage critical infrastructures by controlling the processes based on the “physics” data gathered by edge sensor networks. Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the “security by obscurity” principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding the outputs of these reports. While these reports show that the most exploited vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, these vulnerabilities also occur due to limited or ill-defined security policies. However, current literature focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network traffic analysis (NTA) methods, or anomaly detection techniques. Hence, finding a solution for the problems mentioned in these reports is relatively hard. We bridge this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. Finally, we identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.","[Hakan Kayan, Matthew Nunes, Omer Rana, Pete Burnap, Charith Perera]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[UK, UK, UK, UK, UK]",09 September 2022,9,"[Cardiff University, Roath, Cardiff, UK, Cardiff University, Roath, Cardiff, UK, Cardiff University, Roath, Cardiff, UK, Cardiff University, Roath, Cardiff, UK, Cardiff University, Roath, Cardiff, UK]",September,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[Cardiff University, Cardiff University, Cardiff University, Cardiff University, Cardiff University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ece6

"Social media embeddedness relationships consist of online social networks formed by self-organized individual actors and significantly affect many aspects of our lives. Since the high cost and inefficiency of using population networks generated by social media embeddedness relationships to study practical issues, sampling techniques have become increasingly important than ever. Our work consists of three parts. We first comprehensively analyze current sampling selection methods, evaluation indexes, and evaluation methods in terms of technological evolution. In the second part, we systematically conduct sampling tests using representative large-scale social media datasets. The test results indicate that unequal-probability sampling methods can construct similar sample networks at the macroscale and microscale and outperform the equal-probability methods. However, non-negligible sampling errors at the mesoscale seriously affect the sampling reliability and validity. MANOVA tests show that the direct cause of sampling errors is the low in-degree nodes with medium-high betweenness located between the core and periphery, and current sampling methods cannot accurately sample such complex interconnected structures.

Furthermore, we analyze the 28 most notable botnet takedown operations carried out over from 2008 to 2021, in regard to the methods employed, and illustrate the correlation between these methods and the segments of our adapted business models. Our analysis suggests that the botnet takedown methods have been mainly focused on the technical side, but not on the botnet economic components.

"The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.","[Bo Li, Peng Qi, Bo Liu, Shuai Di, Jingen Liu, Jiquan Pei, Jinfeng Yi, Bowen Zhou]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, USA, USA, China, USA, China, China, China]",18 August 2022,18,"[JD Technology, China and Tsinghua University, China, Amazon AWS AI Labs, USA, Walmart Inc., USA, JD Technology, China, JD Technology, USA, JD Technology, China, Frontis.AI, China, Tsinghua University, China and Frontis.AI, China]",August,ACM Computing Surveys,Q1,ACM Computing Surveys,SURVEY,"[JD Technology, Amazon AWS AI Labs, Walmart Inc., JD Technology, JD Technology, JD Technology, Frontis.AI, Tsinghua University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ecee

"In recent years, a new generation of the Internet of Things (IoT 2.0) is emerging, based on artificial intelligence, the blockchain technology, machine learning, and the constant consolidation of pre-existing systems and subsystems into larger systems. In this work, we construct and examine a proof-of-concept prototype of such a system of systems, which consists of heterogeneous commercial off-the-shelf components, and utilises diverse communication protocols. We recognise the inherent need for lightweight security in this context, and address it by employing a low-cost state-of-the-art security solution. Our solution is based on a novel hardware and software co-engineering paradigm, utilising well-known software-based cryptographic algorithms, in order to maximise the security potential of the hardware security primitive (a Physical Unclonable Function) that is used as a security anchor. The performance of the proposed security solution is evaluated, proving its suitability even for real-time applications. Additionally, the Dolev-Yao attacker model is considered in order to assess the resilience of our solution towards attacks against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the examined system of systems. In this way, it is confirmed that the proposed solution is able to address the emerging security challenges of the oncoming era of systems of systems.","[Nico Mexis, Nikolaos Athanasios Anagnostopoulos]",Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (Q2); Software (Q3),"[Germany, Germany]",30 June 2021,30,"[University of Passau, Germany, Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany and University of Passau, Germany]",June,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems,Q2,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Passau, Technical University of Darmstadt]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ecf0
"Unlike general routing strategies, network coding (NC) can combine encoding functions with multi-path propagation over a network. This allows network capacity to be achieved to support complex security solutions. Moreover, NC has intrinsic security advantages against passive attacks over traditional routing techniques. However, due to the transmission of the global encoding kernels, the system is fragile to eavesdropping attacks with multiple probes. This paper proposes a generic unicast secure transmission scheme based on random linear network coding (RLNC). Specifically, the intended receiver generates a random matrix upon receiving the request from the source node, and then transmits each row vector of this matrix over a link reversely to the source node. Each intermediate node rearranges all received vectors to form a matrix by row, and then post-multiplies its local encoding kernel by this matrix to obtain a new matrix. Similarly, each row vector of the new matrix is reversely transmitted over a link to the source node. This procedure is performed until we have the source node, where the generalized inverse of the received matrix (or part of it) can be used as its local encoding kernel. Hence, the intended receiver can use the generated matrix (or the corresponding part) to decode the received data packets directly. We also analyze the security to demonstrate that the proposed scheme is at least as secure as other methods against wiretapping attacks. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme to demonstrate its utility.","[Domenic Forte, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay, Ilia Polian, Yunsi Fei, Rosario Cammarota]",Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (Q2); Software (Q3),"[, , , , ]",30 June 2021,30,"[, , , , ]",June,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems,Q2,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems,INTRODUCTION,"[, , , , ]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ecf1
"The deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in an untended environment and the openness of the wireless channel bring various security threats to WSN. The resource limitations of the sensor nodes make the conventional security systems less attractive for WSN. Moreover, conventional cryptography alone cannot ensure the desired security against the physical attacks on sensor nodes. Physically unclonable function (PUF) is an emerging hardware security primitive that provides low-cost hardware security exploiting the unique inherent randomness of a device. In this article, we have proposed an authentication and key sharing scheme for the WSN integrating Pedersen’s verifiable secret sharing (Pedersen’s VSS) and Shamir’s secret sharing (Shamir’s SS) scheme with PUF which ensure the desired security with low overhead. The security analysis depicts the resilience of the proposed scheme against different active, passive and physical attacks. Also, the performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme possesses low computation, communication and storage overhead. The scheme only needs to store a polynomial number of PUF challenge-response pairs to the user node. The sink or senor nodes do not require storing any secret key. Finally, the comparison with the previous protocols establishes the dominance of the proposed scheme to use in WSN.","[Mahabub Hasan Mahalat, Dipankar Karmakar, Anindan Mondal, Bibhash Sen]",Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (Q2); Software (Q3),"[India, India, India, India]",29 September 2021,29,"[National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, West Bengal, India, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, West Bengal, India, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, West Bengal, India, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, West Bengal, India]",September,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems,Q2,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[National Institute of Technology Durgapur, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, National Institute of Technology Durgapur]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ecf2
"With social media becoming the most frequently used mode of modern-day communications, the propagation of fake or vicious news through such modes of communication has emerged as a serious problem. The scope of the problem of fake or vicious news may range from rumour-mongering, with intent to defame someone, to manufacturing false opinions/trends impacting elections and stock exchanges to much more alarming and mala fide repercussions of inciting violence by bad actors, especially in sensitive law-and-order situations. Therefore, curbing fake or vicious news and identifying the source of such news to ensure strict accountability is the need of the hour. Researchers have been working in the area of using text analysis, labelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques for detecting fake news, but identifying the source or originator of such news for accountability is still a big challenge for which no concrete approach exists as of today. Also, there is another common problematic trend on social media whereby targeted vicious content goes viral to mobilize or instigate people with malicious intent to destabilize normalcy in society. In the proposed solution, we treat both problems of fake news and vicious news together. We propose a blockchain and keyed watermarking-based framework for social media/messaging platforms that will allow the integrity of the posted content as well as ensure accountability on the owner/user of the post. Intrinsic properties of blockchain-like transparency and immutability are advantageous for curbing fake or vicious news. After identification of fake or vicious news, its spread will be immediately curbed through backtracking as well as forward tracking. Also, observing transactions on the blockchain, the density and rate of forwarding of a particular original message going beyond a threshold can easily be checked, which could be identified as a possible malicious attempt to spread objectionable content. If the content is deemed dangerous or inappropriate, its spread will be curbed immediately. The use of the Raft consensus algorithm and bloXroute servers is proposed to enhance throughput and network scalability, respectively. Thus, the framework offers a proactive as well as reactive, practically feasible, and effective solution for curtailment of fake or vicious news on social media/messaging platforms. The proposed work is a framework for solving fake or vicious news spread problems on social media; the complete design specifications are beyond scope of the current work and will be addressed in the future.","[Sakshi Dhall, Ashutosh Dhar Dwivedi, Saibal K.

"With the development of real-time critical systems, the ever-increasing communication data traffic puts forward high-bandwidth and low-delay requirements for communication networks. Therefore, various real-time Ethernet protocols have been proposed, but these protocols are not compatible with each other. The IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed standardized protocols named Audio Video Bridging (AVB) in 2005, and renamed it Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) later. TSN not only adds new features but also retains the original functions of AVB. Proposing real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies is the key to meeting high-bandwidth and low-delay communication requirements. This article surveys the modeling from AVB to TSN, mainly including: (1) AVB and TSN modeling; (2) end-to-end delay modeling; (3) real-time scheduling modeling; (4) reliability modeling; and (5) security modeling. Based on these models, this article surveys the recent advances in real-time Ethernet design methodologies from AVB to TSN: (1) end-to-end delay analysis from AVB to TSN; (2) real-time scheduling from AVB to TSN; (3) reliability-aware design for TSN; and (4) security-aware design for TSN. Among the above four points, the last two points are only for TSN, because AVB lacks reliability and security mechanisms. This article further takes the automotive use case as an example to discuss the application of TSN in automobiles. Finally, this article discusses the future trends of TSN. By surveying the recent advances and future trends, we hope to provide references for researchers interested in real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies for AVB and TSN.","[Akshi Kumar, Christian Esposito, Dimitrios A.

"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a definite IoT connecting atmosphere that contracts with communication via intelligent medical equipment. Activity detection, motion tracking, information extraction, consumer retrieval, etc., have all been solved due to advances in the autonomous study of human behavior from multimedia information processing. Though the IoT connecting atmosphere enables and provisions our daily actions, it too has certain disadvantages. IoTgrieves from numerous safety and confidentiality challenges, such as reiteration, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, remote hijacking, privileged-insider attack, denial of service (DoS) attacks, password guessing, and malware bouts. Hence, in this paper, Private Blockchain and Fuzzy Logic based Attack Detection system (PBFL-ADS) has been proposed for secure IoMT disease prediction using Multimedia Information Processing techniques. The proposed method utilizes Bayesian inference-based trust administration to perceived malevolent nodes in Health Smartphone Structures (HSS) for PBFL-ADS. This paper focuses on the specific form of IoMT called HSS because smartphones have been widely used in the healthcare profession. Then, blockchains have been utilized to improve Bayesian trust management's efficacy in detecting hostile nodes in HSSs. The effectiveness of the suggested technique has been assessed, and test results show that blockchain technology helps identify fraudulent nodes with an acceptable workload. The proposed PBFL-ADS method increases the HS2 scenario 1.1, processor utilization at nodes 33.5%, pattern recognition ratio 92.1%.and server utilization 40.1%.","[Taher M.

This paper takes the accounting industry as an example, discusses the application of artificial intelligence technology in accounting practice, analyzes its impact on the reform of accounting education, and finally proposes countermeasures and suggestions for accounting education to deal with technological challenges with the blended learning for increasing student retention and engagement in an E-learning environment. Blended learning gives greater flexibility which means being able to complete assignments any place and any time. It successfully improves students’ experience and enhances their engagement. It uses apps, games, or measurable programs and helps to balance the classroom. Practice shows that the development of artificial intelligence technology not only has a profound and extensive impact on the accounting profession and accounting education, but also has a profound impact on engineering education and other fields.

"Many facts change over time, which is a fundamental aspect of our physical environment. In the case of pandemic articles, the user is not interested in the creation date of the document, but in the facts and the cause of the last pandemic. Fake news can be better combated by having a document with a temporal focus. Currently, neither the sequence of events nor the temporal focus is considered when obtaining news documents. Despite the limited number of temporal aspects in the available datasets, it is difficult to test and evaluate the temporal conclusions of the model. The goal of this work is to develop a temporal focus news article retrieval model based on co-training to advance research in semi-supervised learning. A mapping of the dataset is performed using 1) the evolving focus time of news articles, 2) the semi-supervised method based on coincidence contexts for learning low-dimensional continuous vectors for learning neural contrast embedding models generating focus time-based query in sequential news articles to facilitate temporal understanding by learning low-dimensional continuous vectors. A diverse dataset of news articles is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

"Fake news detection recently received a lot of attention from the scientific community and demands an optimal solution with high efficiency. Several studies were conducted using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to address the fake news identification problem.

Some factors contributing to poor accuracy include irrelevant features, improper model parameters, imbalanced datasets, and so on.

The developed model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify fake and real news and utilizes hyperparameter tuning methods such as grid search and random search to customize the hyperparameters of the model. The experimental results indicate that the optimized LSTM model yields 99.65% accuracy using the ISOT dataset and 45.23% accuracy using the LIAR dataset.","[R.R. Rajalaxmi, L.V. Narasimha Prasad, B.

As an attack mitigation strategy, we assume it is not possible to fix all the vulnerabilities and propose to diversify the open-source software used to manage IoT devices. Our approach is to deploy dynamic cloud-based virtual machine proxies for physical IoT devices. Our architecture leverages virtual machine proxies with diverse software configurations to mitigate vulnerable and static software configurations on physical devices. We develop an algorithm for selecting new configurations based on network anomaly detection signals to learn vulnerable software configurations on IoT devices, automatically shifting towards more secure configurations. Cloud-based proxy machines mediate requests between application clients and vulnerable IoT devices, facilitating a dynamic diversification system. We report on simulation experiments to evaluate the dynamic system. Two models of powerful adversaries are introduced and simulated against the diversified defense strategy.

Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things.

"This paper presents an annotated portfolio of projects that seek to understand and communicate the social and societal implications of blockchains, DLTs and smart contracts. These complex technologies rely on human and technical factors to deliver cryptocurrencies, shared computation and trustless protocols but have a secondary benefit in providing a moment to re-think many aspects of society, and imagine alternative possibilities. The projects use design and HCI methods to relate blockchains to a range of topics, including global supply chains, delivery infrastructure, smart grids, volunteering and charitable giving, through engaging publics, exploring ideas and speculating on possible futures. Based on an extensive annotated portfolio we draw out learning for the design of blockchain systems, broadening participation and surfacing questions around imaginaries, social implications and engagement with new technology.

"The standard definition for “physicalizations” is “a physical artifact whose geometry or material properties encode data” [47]. While this working definition provides the fundamental groundwork for conceptualizing physicalization, in practice many physicalization systems go beyond the scope of this definition as they consist of distributed physical and digital elements that involve complex interaction mechanisms. In this article, we examine how “physicalization” is part of a broader ecology—the “physecology”—with properties that go beyond the scope of the working definition. Through analyzing 60 representative physicalization papers, we derived six design dimensions of a physecology: (i) represented data type, (ii) way of information communication, (iii) interaction mechanisms, (iv) spatial input–output coupling, (v) physical setup, and (vi) audiences involved. Our contribution is the extension of the definition of physicalization to the broader concept of “physecology,” to provide conceptual clarity on the design of physicalizations for future work.","[Kim Sauvé, Miriam Sturdee, Steven Houben]",Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[United Kingdom, United Kingdom, The Netherlands]",14 January 2022,14,"[Lancaster University, United Kingdom, Lancaster University, United Kingdom, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands]",January,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,Q2,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Lancaster University, Lancaster University, Eindhoven University of Technology]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed03
"Students’ lives, both in and out of school, are full of different forms of value. Wealthy students enjoy value in the form of financial capital; their fit to hegemonic social practices; excellent health care and so on. Low-income students, especially those from African American, Native American, and Latinx communities, often lack access to those resources. But there are other forms of value that low-income students do possess. Most examples of what we will call Counter-Hegemonic Practice (CHP) in the African American community involve some mixture of Indigenous African heritage, contemporary innovation in the Black community, and other influences. Moving between these value forms and the computing classroom is a non-trivial task, especially if we are to avoid merely using the appearance of culture to attract students. Our objective in this paper is to provide a framework for deeper investigations into the computational potentials for CHP; its potential as a link between education and community development; and a more dignified role for its utilization in the CS classroom.

"Internet of Things (IoT) is composed of physical devices, communication networks, and services provided by edge systems and over-the-top applications. IoT connects billions of devices that collect data from the physical environment, which are pre-processed at the edge and then forwarded to processing services at the core of the infrastructure, on top of which cloud-based applications are built and provided to mobile end users. IoT comes with important advantages in terms of applications and added value for its users, making their world smarter and simpler. These advantages, however, are mitigated by the difficulty of guaranteeing IoT trustworthiness, which is still in its infancy. IoT trustworthiness is a must especially in critical domains (e.g., health, transportation) where humans become new components of an IoT system and their life is put at risk by system malfunctioning or breaches. In this article, we put forward the idea that trust in IoT can be boosted if and only if its automation and adaptation processes are based on trustworthy data. We therefore depart from a scenario that considers the quality of a single decision as the main goal of an IoT system and consider the trustworthiness of collected data as a fundamental requirement at the basis of a trustworthy IoT environment. We therefore define a methodology for data collection that filters untrusted data out according to trust rules evaluating the status of the devices collecting data and the collected data themselves. Our approach is based on blockchain and smart contracts and collects data whose trustworthiness and integrity are proven over time. The methodology balances trustworthiness and privacy and is experimentally evaluated in real-world and simulated scenarios using Hyperledger fabric blockchain.","[Claudio A.

"Connected vehicles are set to define the future of transportation; however, this upcoming technology continues to be plagued with serious security risks. If these risks are not addressed in a timely fashion, then they could threaten the adoption and success of this promising technology. This article deals with a specific class of attacks in connected vehicles, namely tampering attacks caused due to compromise of on-board sensors. Current centralized solutions that employ trusted infrastructure to protect against adversarial manipulation of information cannot validate the correctness of the shared data and do not scale well. To overcome these issues, decentralized protection mechanisms by means of blockchain technology have emerged as a promising research direction. However, current permission-less, linear blockchain-based solutions have low transaction performance and high computational cost, thereby making it difficult to adopt them for security in connected vehicles. In this article, we present TangleCV, a directed acyclic graph–based distributed ledger technique for connected vehicles to address data tampering threats in connected vehicular networks. We describe new validation steps, tip selection strategies, and cumulative weight definition for TangleCV that not only meets the timing constraints of the connected vehicular networks but also secures the network against threats due to tampering attacks. We describe how the reputation of the network is established in TangleCV using trust factors calculated on the basis of ability, integrity, and benevolence of the nodes in the network. We present numerical results that demonstrate that the average value of the time to first approval decreases by more than 70% as the network evolves from a low load to a high load in the case of the nearest neighbor strategy. We observe that more than 60% of the nodes are approved in a low-load network and this number increases to 80% in a high-load network for the nearest neighbor strategy. The standard deviation of error measurements for nodes experiencing tampering attack is around 60% higher as compared to nodes that do not experience such an attack.","[Heena Rathore, Abhay Samant, Murtuza Jadliwala]",Artificial Intelligence (Q2); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Control and Optimization (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[USA, USA, USA]",30 December 2020,30,"[The University of Texas at San Antonio, USA, National Instruments, USA, The University of Texas at San Antonio, USA]",December,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,Q2,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[The University of Texas at San Antonio, National Instruments, The University of Texas at San Antonio]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ed07
"Outsourcing helps relocate data from the cyber-physical system (CPS) for efficient storage at low cost. Current server-based outsourcing mainly focuses on the benefits of servers. This cannot attract users well, as their security, efficiency, and economy are not guaranteed. To solve with this issue, a hybrid outsourcing model that exploits both cloud server and edge devices to store data is needed. Meanwhile, the requirements of security and efficiency are different under specific scenarios. There is a lack of a comprehensive solution that considers all of the above issues. In this work, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first hybrid user-centric data outsourcing (HUCDO) scheme. It allows users to outsource data securely, efficiently, and economically via different CPSs. Brielly, our contributions consist of theories, implementations, and evaluations. Our theories include the first homomorphic collision-resistant chameleon hash (HCCH) and homomorphic designated-receiver signcryption (HDRS). As implementations, we instantiate how to use our proposals to outsource small- or large-scale data through distinct CPS, respectively. Additionally, a blockchain with proof-of-discrete-logarithm (B-PoDL) is instantiated to help improve our performance.

"Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results.","[Scott Eisele, Taha Eghtesad, Keegan Campanelli, Prakhar Agrawal, Aron Laszka, Abhishek Dubey]",Artificial Intelligence (Q2); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Control and Optimization (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[, , , , , ]",30 December 2020,30,"[Vanderbilt University, University of Houston, Vanderbilt University, Vanderbilt University, University of Houston, Vanderbilt University]",December,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,Q2,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Vanderbilt University, University of Houston, Vanderbilt University, Vanderbilt University, University of Houston, Vanderbilt University]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ed09
"Recent work has demonstrated significant anonymity vulnerabilities in Bitcoin's networking stack. In particular, the current mechanism for broadcasting Bitcoin transactions allows third-party observers to link transactions to the IP addresses that originated them.

Dandelion++ builds upon a recent proposal called Dandelion that exhibited similar goals. However, in this paper, we highlight some simplifying assumptions made in Dandelion, and show how they can lead to serious deanonymization attacks when violated. In contrast, Dandelion++ defends against stronger adversaries that are allowed to disobey protocol. Dandelion++ is lightweight, scalable, and completely interoperable with the existing Bitcoin network.

"Today we are relying on Internet technologies for numerous services, for example, personal communication, online businesses, recruitment, and entertainment. Over these networks, people usually create content, a skillful worker profile, and provide services that are normally watched and used by other users, thus developing a social network among people termed as the Internet of People. Malicious users could also utilize such platforms for spreading unwanted content that could bring catastrophic consequences to a social network provider and the society, if not identified on time. The use of trust management over these networks plays a vital role in the success of these services. Crowd-sensing people or network users for their views about certain content or content creators could be a potential solution to assess the trustworthiness of content creators and their content. However, the human involvement in crowd-sensing would have challenges of privacy preservation and preventing intentional assignment of the fake high score given to certain user/content. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel trust model that evaluates the aggregate trustworthiness of the content creator and the content without compromising the privacy of the participating people in a crowdsource group. The proposed system has inherent properties of privacy protection of participants, performs operations in the decentralized setup, and considers the trust weights of participants in a private and secure way. The system ensures privacy of participants under the malicious and honest-but-curious adversarial models. We evaluated the performance of the system by developing a prototype and applying it to different real data from different online social networks.","[Muhammad Ajmal Azad, Charith Perera, Samiran Bag, Mahmoud Barhamgi, Feng Hao]",Artificial Intelligence (Q2); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Control and Optimization (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[United Kingdom, United Kingdom, United Kingdom, France, United Kingdom]",30 December 2020,30,"[School of Computing, The University of Derby, United Kingdom, School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University, United Kingdom, Department of Computer Science, Warwick University, United Kingdom, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, France, Department of Computer Science, Warwick University, United Kingdom]",December,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,Q2,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computing, School of Computer Science and Informatics, Department of Computer Science, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, Department of Computer Science]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ed0b

"Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle.","[Md Nazmul Islam, Sandip Kundu]",Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q2); Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design (Q3); Computer Science Applications (Q3),"[USA, USA]",05 April 2019,5,"[University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA]",April,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,Q2,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Massachusetts Amherst]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ed0e

In the past few decades, the security of software running on these systems has received significant attention. However, hardware has been assumed to be trustworthy and reliable “by default” without really analyzing the vulnerabilities in the electronics supply chain. With the rapid globalization of the semiconductor industry, it has become challenging to ensure the integrity and security of hardware. In this article, we discuss the integrity concerns associated with a globalized electronics supply chain. More specifically, we divide the supply chain into six distinct entities: IP owner/foundry (OCM), distributor, assembler, integrator, end user, and electronics recycler, and analyze the vulnerabilities and threats associated with each stage. To address the concerns of the supply chain integrity, we propose a blockchain-based certificate authority framework that can be used to manage critical chip information such as electronic chip identification, chip grade, and transaction time. The decentralized nature of the proposed framework can mitigate most threats of the electronics supply chain, such as recycling, remarking, cloning, and overproduction.","[Xiaolin Xu, Fahim Rahman, Bicky Shakya, Apostol Vassilev, Domenic Forte, Mark Tehranipoor]",Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q2); Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design (Q3); Computer Science Applications (Q3),"[IL, FL, FL, MD, FL, FL]",09 May 2019,9,"[University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL]",May,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,Q2,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Florida, University of Florida, National Institute of Standards and Technology, University of Florida, University of Florida]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ed0f
"We do a game-theoretic analysis of leader election, under the assumption that each agent prefers to have some leader than no leader at all. We show that it is possible to obtain a fair Nash equilibrium, where each agent has an equal probability of being elected leader, in a completely connected network, in a bidirectional ring, and a unidirectional ring, in the synchronous setting. In the asynchronous setting, Nash equilibrium is not quite the right solution concept. Rather, we must consider ex post Nash equilibrium; this means that we have a Nash equilibrium no matter what a scheduling adversary does. We show that ex post Nash equilibrium is attainable in the asynchronous setting in all the networks we consider, using a protocol with bounded running time. However, in the asynchronous setting, we require that n > 2. We show that we can get a fair ex post ϵ-Nash equilibrium if n=2 in the asynchronous setting under some cryptographic assumptions (specifically, the existence of a one-way functions), using a commitment protocol. We then generalize these results to a setting where we can have deviations by a coalition of size k. In this case, we can get what we call a fair k-resilient equilibrium in a completely connected network if n> 2k; under the same cryptographic assumptions, we can a get a k-resilient equilibrium in a completely connected network, unidirectional ring, or bidirectional ring if n > k. Finally, we show that under minimal assumptions, not only do our protocols give a Nash equilibrium, they also give a sequential equilibrium, so players even play optimally off the equilibrium path.","[Ittai Abraham, Danny Dolev, Joseph Y.

Two of Bitcoin’s challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin’s pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the “monopolistic auction” [16], showing (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one’s value) diminishes as the number of bids increases.","[Ron Lavi, Or Sattath, Aviv Zohar]",Computational Mathematics (Q1); Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Economics and Econometrics (Q1); Statistics and Probability (Q1); Marketing (Q2),"[Israel, Israel, Israel]",18 May 2022,18,"[University of Bath, United Kingdom, Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem , Israel]",May,ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation,Q1,ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Bath, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed11

We present LayerCode, a tagging scheme that embeds a carefully designed barcode pattern in 3D printed objects as a deliberate byproduct of the 3D printing process. The LayerCode concept is inspired by the structural resemblance between the parallel black and white bars of the standard barcode and the universal layer-by-layer approach of 3D printing. We introduce an encoding algorithm that enables the 3D printing layers to carry information without altering the object geometry. We also introduce a decoding algorithm that reads the LayerCode tag of a physical object by just taking a photo. The physical deployment of LayerCode tags is realized on various types of 3D printers, including Fused Deposition Modeling printers as well as Stereolithography based printers. Each offers its own advantages and tradeoffs. We show that LayerCode tags can work on complex, nontrivial shapes, on which all previous tagging mechanisms may fail. To evaluate LayerCode thoroughly, we further stress test it with a large dataset of complex shapes using virtual rendering.

"Owing to its nature of scalability and privacy by design, federated learning (FL) has received increasing interest in decentralized deep learning. FL has also facilitated recent research on upscaling and privatizing personalized recommendation services, using on-device data to learn recommender models locally. These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant model, while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems (FRSs) do not take into account the lack of resources and data availability at the end-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users and items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices (i.e., users), and that all local recommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user’s behavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be made on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources. Furthermore, users’ preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new items. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the straightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data. In this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System (ReFRS) to enable decentralized recommendation with dynamic and diversified user preferences. On the device side, ReFRS consists of a lightweight self-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning a user’s temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items. On the server side, ReFRS utilizes a scalable semantic sampler to adaptively perform model aggregation within each identified cluster of similar users. The clustering module operates in an asynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and cope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by comparative experiments on real datasets.","[Mubashir Imran, Hongzhi Yin, Tong Chen, Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung, Alexander Zhou, Kai Zheng]","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous) (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Information Systems (Q1)","[Australia, Australia, Australia, Australia, China, China]",29 August 2022,29,"[The University of Queensland, Australia, The University of Queensland, Australia, The University of Queensland, Australia, Griffith University, Australia, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China]",August,ACM Transactions on Information Systems,Q1,ACM Transactions on Information Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[The University of Queensland, The University of Queensland, The University of Queensland, Griffith University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed13

"From facial recognition to autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform the way we live and work over the next couple of decades. Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients. All these improvements make StarFL more applicable to the security-sensitive scenarios for the next generation of urban computing.","[Anbu Huang, Yang Liu, Tianjian Chen, Yongkai Zhou, Quan Sun]",Artificial Intelligence (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China]",01 August 2021,1,"[WeBank, China, WeBank, China, WeBank, China, China UnionPay, China, China UnionPay, China]",August,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[WeBank, WeBank, WeBank, China UnionPay, China UnionPay]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed1a
"Through the collaboration of cloud and edge, cloud-edge computing allows the edge that approximates end-users undertakes those non-computationally intensive service processing of the cloud, reducing the communication overhead and satisfying the low latency requirement of Internet of Vehicle (IoV). With cloud-edge computing, the computing tasks in IoV is able to be delivered to the edge servers (ESs) instead of the cloud and rely on the deployed services of ESs for a series of processing. Due to the storage and computing resource limits of ESs, how to dynamically deploy partial services to the edge is still a puzzle. Moreover, the decision of service deployment often requires the transmission of local service requests from ESs to the cloud, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, a method for privacy-aware IoV service deployment with federated learning in cloud-edge computing, named PSDF, is proposed. Technically, federated learning secures the distributed training of deployment decision network on each ES by the exchange and aggregation of model weights, avoiding the original data transmission. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is adopted for the uploaded weights before the model aggregation on the cloud. Besides, a service deployment scheme based on deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed. Eventually, the performance of PSDF is evaluated by massive experiments.","[Xiaolong Xu, Wentao Liu, Yulan Zhang, Xuyun Zhang, Wanchun Dou, Lianyong Qi, Md Zakirul Alam Bhuiyan]",Artificial Intelligence (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, China, China, Australia, China, China, USA]",13 October 2022,13,"[School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, Weifang Key Laboratory of Blockchain on Agricultural Vegetables, WeiFang University of Science and Technology, Shouguang, China, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, and Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Soochow, China, School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, Weifang Key Laboratory of Blockchain on Agricultural Vegetables, WeiFang University of Science and Technology, Shouguang, China, Department of Computing, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, School of Information Science and Engineering, Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China, Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Fordham University, New York, USA]",October,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer and Software, School of Computer and Software, Weifang Key Laboratory of Blockchain on Agricultural Vegetables, Department of Computing, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, School of Information Science and Engineering, Department of Computer and Information Sciences]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed1b
"The use of machine learning (ML) with electronic health records (EHR) is growing in popularity as a means to extract knowledge that can improve the decision-making process in healthcare. Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it. FL is a promising solution to improve ML-based systems, better aligning them to regulatory requirements, improving trustworthiness and data sovereignty. However, many open questions must be addressed before the use of FL becomes widespread. This article aims at presenting a systematic literature review on current research about FL in the context of EHR data for healthcare applications. Our analysis highlights the main research topics, proposed solutions, case studies, and respective ML methods. Furthermore, the article discusses a general architecture for FL applied to healthcare data based on the main insights obtained from the literature review. The collected literature corpus indicates that there is extensive research on the privacy and confidentiality aspects of training data and model sharing, which is expected given the sensitive nature of medical data.

"The rapid development of modern artificial intelligence technique is mainly attributed to sufficient and high-quality data. However, in the data collection, personal privacy is at risk of being leaked. This issue can be addressed by federated learning, which is proposed to achieve efficient model training among multiple data providers without direct data access and aggregation. To encourage more parties owning high-quality data to participate in the federated learning, it is important to evaluate and reward the participant contribution in a reasonable, robust, and efficient manner. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel contribution estimation method: Intrinsic Performance Influence-based Contribution Estimation (IPICE). In particular, the class-level intrinsic performance influence is adopted as the contribution estimation criteria in IPICE, and a neural network is employed to exploit the non-linear relationship between the performance change and estimated contribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, and the results demonstrate that IPICE is more accurate and stable than the counterpart in various data distribution settings. The computational complexity is significantly reduced in our IPICE, especially when a new party joins the federation. IPICE assigns small contributions to bad/garbage data and thus prevent them from participating and deteriorating the learning ecosystem.","[Lin Zhang, Lixin Fan, Yong Luo, Ling-Yu Duan]",Artificial Intelligence (Q1); Theoretical Computer Science (Q1),"[China, China, China, China]",22 September 2022,22,"[Peking University, Beijing, China, WeBank, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, Peking University, Beijing, China]",September,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Peking University, WeBank, Wuhan University, Peking University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed1d

Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas.

"Blockchain technology, whose most successful application is Bitcoin, enables non-repudiation and non-tamperable online transactions without the participation of a trusted central party. As a global ledger, the blockchain achieves the consistency of replica stored on each node through a consensus mechanism. A well-designed consensus mechanism, on one hand, needs to be efficient to meet the high frequency of online transactions. For example, the existing electronic payment systems can handle over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Bitcoin can only handle an average of about 3TPS. On the other hand, it needs to have good security and high fault tolerance; that is, in the case when some nodes are captured by adversaries, the network can still operate normally. In this article, we establish a reputation system, called RTChain, to be integrated into the e-commerce blockchain to achieve a distributed consensus and transaction incentives. The proposed scheme has the following advantages. First, an incentive mechanism is used to influence the consensus behavior of nodes and the transaction behavior of users, which in turn influence the reputation scores of both nodes and users. That is, when a node correctly processes a transaction, it will receive the corresponding reputation value as a reward, and the reputation value will be reduced as punishment not only when the node is dishonest and violates the consensus agreement but also the transaction is not completed as required. Just like electronic transactions in the real world, the higher the reputation of the user, the more likely it is to be selected as the transaction partner. A user with a low reputation will be gradually eliminated in our system because it is difficult to complete the transaction. Second, RTChain uses a verifiable random function to generate the leader in each round, which guarantees fairness for all participants and, unlike PoW, does not consume a large amount of computing resources. Then our consensus mechanism selects the nodes with high reputation scores to reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus, thus improving the consensus efficiency, so that RTChain’s throughput can reach 4,000TPS. Third, we built a reputation chain to implement the distributed storage and management of reputation. Finally, our consensus mechanism is secure against existing attacks, such as flash attacks, selfish mining attacks, eclipse attacks, and double spending attacks, and allows nodes that participate in the consensus to fail, as long as the reputation of the failure node does not exceed one-third of the total reputation. We build a prototype of RTChain, and the experimental results show that RTChain is promising and deployable for e-commerce blockchains.","[You Sun, Rui Xue, Rui Zhang, Qianqian Su, Sheng Gao]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China]",17 December 2020,17,"[State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), Institute of Information Engineering, CAS School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, School of Information, Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China]",December,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS), School of Information]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ed26

"Modern software development is increasingly dependent on components, libraries, and frameworks coming from third-party vendors or open-source suppliers and made available through a number of platforms (or forges). This way of writing software puts an emphasis on reuse and on composition, commoditizing the services that modern applications require. On the other hand, bugs and vulnerabilities in a single library living in one such ecosystem can affect, directly or by transitivity, a huge number of other libraries and applications. Currently, only product-level information on library dependencies is used to contain this kind of danger, but this knowledge often reveals itself too imprecise to lead to effective (and possibly automated) handling policies.

"Next (or successive) point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict where users are likely to go next, has recently emerged as a new research focus of POI recommendation. Most of the previous studies on next POI recommendation attempted to incorporate the spatiotemporal information and sequential patterns of user check-ins into recommendation models to predict the target user's next move. However, few of the next POI recommendation approaches utilized the social influence of each user's friends. In this study, we discuss a new topic of next POI recommendation and present a deep attentive network for social-aware next POI recommendation called DAN-SNR. In particular, the DAN-SNR makes use of the self-attention mechanism instead of the architecture of recurrent neural networks to model sequential influence and social influence in a unified manner. Moreover, we design and implement two parallel channels to capture short-term user preference and long-term user preference as well as social influence, respectively. By leveraging multi-head self-attention, the DAN-SNR can model long-range dependencies between any two historical check-ins efficiently and weigh their contributions to the next destination adaptively. We also carried out a comprehensive evaluation using large-scale real-world datasets collected from two popular location-based social networks, namely, Gowalla and Brightkite. Experimental results indicate that the DAN-SNR outperforms seven competitive baseline approaches regarding recommendation performance and is highly efficient among six neural-network-based methods, four of which utilize the attention mechanism.","[Liwei Huang, Yutao Ma, Yanbo Liu, Keqing He]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, China]",22 December 2020,22,"[School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China and Beijing Institute of Remote Sensing, Beijing, China, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, Beijing Institute of Remote Sensing, Beijing, China, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China]",December,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Remote Sensing, School of Computer Science]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ed2c
"Trust in Secure Sockets Layer–based communications is traditionally provided by Certificate (or Certification) Authorities (CAs) in the form of signed certificates. Checking the validity of a certificate involves three steps: (i) checking its expiration date, (ii) verifying its signature, and (iii) ensuring that it is not revoked. Currently, such certificate revocation checks (i.e., step (iii) above) are done either via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) servers. Unfortunately, despite the existence of these revocation checks, sophisticated cyber-attackers can still trick web browsers to trust a revoked certificate, believing that it is still valid.","[Michalis Pachilakis, Antonios A.

"Recent advances in cryptographic approaches, such as Functional Encryption and Attribute-based Encryption and their variants, have shown significant promise for enabling public clouds to provide secure computation and storage services for users’ sensitive data. A crucial component of these approaches is a third-party authority (TPA) that must be trusted to set up public parameters, provide private key service, and so on. Components of deployed cryptographic mechanisms such as the certificate authorities (CAs), which are the TPAs of the underlying PKI for the SSL/TLS protocol, have faced several types of attacks (e.g., stealthy targeted and censorship attacks), and certificate mis-issuance problems. Such practical challenges indicate that the successful deployment of newer emerging cryptographic schemes will also significantly depend on the trustworthiness of the TPAs. Furthermore, recently proposed decentralized TPA approaches that lower the threshold on the conditions required for an entity to become an authority can make the trust issue much worse. To address this issue, we propose an authority transparency framework to ensure the trustworthiness of TPAs of recent and emerging advanced cryptographic schemes. The framework includes a formal model and a secure logging-based approach to implement the framework. Further, to address the issues related to privacy, we also present a privacy-preserving authority transparency approach. We present security analysis and performance evaluation to show that authority transparency achieves the security and performance goals.","[Runhua Xu, James Joshi]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[United States, United States]",15 October 2020,15,"[University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States]",October,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ed2e

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals’ quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner’s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.","[Faiza Loukil, Chirine Ghedira-Guegan, Khouloud Boukadi, Aïcha-Nabila Benharkat, Elhadj Benkhelifa]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[France, France, Tunisia, France, UK]",05 January 2021,5,"[University of Lyon, University Jean Moulin Lyon 3, CNRS, LIRIS, France, University of Lyon, iaelyon school of Management, University Jean Moulin Lyon 3, CNRS, LIRIS, France, Mir@cl Laboratory, Sfax University, Tunisia, University of Lyon, INSALyon, CNRS, LIRIS, France, Staffordshire University, Stoke on Trent, UK]",January,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Lyon, University of Lyon, Mir@cl Laboratory, University of Lyon, Staffordshire University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed31
"Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open environment.

To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth.

However, due to the tremendous complicated transactions in the supply chain, it remains challenging to select the credible primary peers in the concurrent clusters. To address this challenge, the peers in the supply chain are classified into several clusters by analyzing the historic transactions in the ledger.

"In recent years, vaccine incidents occurred around the world, which endangers people’s lives. In the technical respect, these incidents are partially due to the fact that existing vaccine management systems are distributively managed by different entities in the vaccine supply chain. This architecture makes it relatively easy to modify or even delete the vaccine circulation data maliciously, which makes tracing problematic vaccine hard and identifying the responsibility for a vaccine accident hard. To solve these issues, this article presents a blockchain-based solution to protect the whole process of vaccine circulation. We first propose a model to supervise the vaccine circulation process by incorporating existing regulatory practices. Then, we propose a blockchain-based tracing system to implement this model. The proposed system takes the blockchain as a global, unique, and verifiable database to store all the circulation data. Through data insertions and queries on the global and unique database, the proposed system achieves the protection of vaccine circulation.

"The rise of fast communication media both at the core and at the edge has resulted in unprecedented numbers of sophisticated and intelligent wireless IoT devices. Tactile Internet has enabled the interaction between humans and machines within their environment to achieve revolutionized solutions both on the move and in real-time.

Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given to resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative resource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated with the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure communication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer computing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and reliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning technique.

"Deep learning techniques have shown significant success in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). As an instance of deep learning models, generative adversarial nets (GAN) model enables powerful and flexible image augmentation, image generation, and classification, thus can be applied to real-world CPSS settings. GAN model training needs a large collection of cyber-physical-social data originating from various CPSS devices. Numerous prevailing GAN models depend on a tacit assumption that several cyber-physical-social data providers present a reliable source to collect training data, which is seldom the case in real CPSS. The existing GAN models also fail to consider multi-dimensional latent structure. In our work, we put forward a novel blockchain-enabled tensor-based conditional deep convolutional GAN (TCDC-GAN) model for cyber-physical-social systems. The blockchain is employed to develop a decentralized and reliable cyber-physical-social data-sharing platform between numerous cyber-physical-social data providers, such that the training data and the model are documented on a ledger that is distributed. Furthermore, a tensor-based generator and a tensor-based discriminator are well designed by employing the tensor model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show the efficacy of the proposed TCDC-GAN model.

"Green Internet of things (GIoT) generally refers to a new generation of Internet of things design concept. It can save energy and reduce emissions, reduce environmental pollution, waste of resources, and harm to human body and environment, in which green smart device (GSD) is a basic unit of GIoT for saving energy. With the access of a large number of heterogeneous bottom-layer GSDs in GIoT, user access and control of GSDs have become more and more complicated. Since there is no unified GSD management system, users need to operate different GIoT applications and access different GIoT cloud platforms when accessing and controlling these heterogeneous GSDs. This fragmented GSD management model not only increases the complexity of user access and control for heterogeneous GSDs, but also reduces the scalability of GSDs applications. To address this issue, this article presents a blockchain-empowered general GSD access control framework, which provides users with a unified GSD management platform. First, based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) decentralized identifiers (DIDs) standard, users and GSD are issued visual identity (VID). Then, we extended the GSD-DIDs protocol to authenticate devices and users. Finally, based on the characteristics of decentralization and non-tampering of blockchain, a unified access control system for GSD was designed, including the registration, granting, and revoking of access rights. We implement and test on the Raspberry Pi device and the FISCO-BCOS alliance chain. The experimental results prove that the framework provides a unified and feasible way for users to achieve decentralized, lightweight, and fine-grained access control of GSDs. The solution reduces the complexity of accessing and controlling GSDs, enhances the scalability of GSD applications, as well as guarantees the credibility and immutability of permission data and identity data during access.","[Liang Tan, Na Shi, Keping Yu, Moayad Aloqaily, Yaser Jararweh]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, Japan, Canada, USA]",16 June 2021,16,"[College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, China and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, Sichuan, China, Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, Faculty of Engineering, Al Ain University, UAE, Ottawa, Canada, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Duquesne University, USA]",June,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[College of Computer Science, College of Computer Science, Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed3a
"In blockchain networks, reaching effective supervision while maintaining anonymity to the public has been an ongoing challenge. In existing solutions, certification authorities need to record all pairs of identities and pseudonyms, which is demanding and costly. This article proposed an account guarantee scheme to realize feasible supervision for existing anonymous blockchain networks with lower storage costs. Users are able to guarantee anonymous accounts with account guarantee key pairs generated from certificated polynomial functions, which inherently maintains one-to-n mapping certifications.

"Pervasive Social Networking (PSN) supports online and instant social activities with the support of heterogeneous networks. Since reciprocal activities among both familiar/unfamiliar strangers and acquaintances are quite common in PSN, it is essential to offer trust information to PSN users. Past work normally evaluates trust based on a centralized party, which is not feasible due to the dynamic changes of PSN topology and its specific characteristics. The literature still lacks a decentralized trust evaluation scheme in PSN. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized system for trust evaluation in PSN, called Social-Chain. Considering mobile devices normally lack computing resources to process cryptographic puzzle calculation, we design a lightweight consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Trust (PoT), which remarkably improves system effectivity compared with other blockchain systems. Serious security analysis and experimental results further illustrate the security and efficiency of Social-Chain for being feasibly applied into PSN.","[Zheng Yan, Li Peng, Wei Feng, Laurence T.

"The sensing-as-a-service (SaaS) model has been explored to address the challenge of intractability of managing a large number of sensors faced by future smart cities. However, how to effectively share sensor data without compromising confidentiality, privacy protection, and fair trading without third parties is one of critical issues that must be solved in the SaaS in smart cities. While blockchain shows promise in solving these issues, the existing blockchain-based data sharing (BBDS) systems are difficult to apply to SaaS in smart cities because of many unresolved issues such as requiring a customized blockchain, huge storage, communication and computation costs, and dependence on a third party to achieve fair trading. We propose a BBDS system model with its security requirements before we present a concrete construction by combining
-protocol, Paillier encryption scheme, and any secure symmetrical encryption and signature schemes. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed BBDS system, we present a security analysis and compare our system with other solutions. We implement the prototype in Remix to analyze the gas cost, and we conduct experiments to evaluate the communication and computation costs of the BBDS system using symmetric encryption (advanced encryption standard (AES)) and a signature scheme (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)).","[Chao Lin, Debiao He, Sherali Zeadally, Xinyi Huang, Zhe Liu]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, USA, China, China]",15 March 2021,15,"[School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, China and Cyberspace Security Research Center, Peng Cheng Laboratory, China, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, China and Cyberspace Security Research Center, Peng Cheng Laboratory, China, College of Communication and Information, University of Kentucky, USA, College of Mathematics and Informatics, Fujian Normal University, China and Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Security and Cryptology, China, College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China]",March,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Cyber Science and Engineering, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, College of Communication and Information, College of Mathematics and Informatics, College of Computer Science and Technology]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed3d
"Blockchain can potentially be appropriated as a social computing technology, which enables transactions across people and artefacts via a large socio-technical information infrastructure constituted by the actions of multiple people and computers. However, Blockchain is not a social computing technology a priori; instead to emerge as one, much effort and work is required to radically transform existing domains, including wrestling with traditions, standards, and legacy. In this article, we expand on previous work on Blockchain as an information infrastructure, and on the notion of infrastructural grind. Infrastructural grind allows us to analytically explore how the emerging Blockchain technology is appropriated into established business domains, in our case the shipping industry. We present ethnographic data unpacking three different accounts of infrastructural grind taking place at the intersection of the shipping and the Blockchain information infrastructures. The results demonstrate that infrastructural grind occurs as a result of various infrastructuring activities taking place at different intersections between the two infrastructures and is constituted of the sum of these activities. We propose a framework in which infrastructural grind is constituted of three entangled dimensions: permeability, interoperability, and velocity. These socio-technical dimensions relate to infrastructural properties such as legacy, embeddedness, and standards, as well as to technical properties of specific solutions deployed at specific points of infrastructural grind. Our analysis shows that these dimensions are enacted differently along the shipping supply chain, and depending on the dynamic interplay between them at various points of infrastructural grind. At different points in time, the infrastructural grind between Blockchain and the shipping domain will thus manifest itself differently and at differential velocity.","[Kim Kwang Raymond Choo, Uttam Ghosh, Deepak Tosh, Reza M.

"At present, clients can outsource lots of complex and abundant computation, e.g., Internet of things (IoT), tasks to clouds by the “pay as you go” model. Outsourcing computation can save costs for clients and fully utilize the existing cloud infrastructures. However, it is hard for clients to trust the clouds even if blockchain is used as the trusted platform. In this article, we utilize the verification method as SETI@home by only two rational clouds, who hope to maximize their utilities. Utilities are defined as the incomes of clouds when they provide computation results to clients. More specifically, one client outsources two jobs to two clouds and each job contains n tasks, which include k identical sentinels. Two clouds can either honestly compute each task or collude on the identical sentinel tasks by agreeing on random values. If the results of identical sentinels are identical, then client regards the jobs as correctly computed without verification. Obviously, rational clouds have incentives to deviate by collusion and provide identical random results for a higher income. We discuss how to prevent collusion by using deposits, e.g., bit-coins. Furthermore, utilities for each cloud can be automatically assigned by a smart contract. We prove that, given proper parameters, two rational clouds will honestly send correct results to the client without collusion.","[Hongyang Yan, Nan Jiang, Kang Li, Yilei Wang, Guoyu Yang]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Guangzhou and Peng Cheng Laboratory, China, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China, China]",11 November 2021,11,"[Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou and Peng Cheng Laboratory, School of Information Engineering, East China Jiaotong University, China, Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, School of Information Science and Engineering, Qufu Normal University, China, School of Information Science and Engineering, Qufu Normal University, China]",November,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, School of Information Engineering, Department of Computing, School of Information Science and Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed3f

"Korean education-related evaluation agencies utilize a centralized system that directly manages learner data. This leaves the intellectual property of the organizations and the personal information of the students vulnerable to leakage should the central server be attacked. In this study, the researchers propose a multilateral personal portfolio authentication system that guarantees the reliability, integrity, and transparency of the data such as learner's schooling history. The system uses the features of blockchain in a distributed network wherein a learner submits schooling data to a peer in the network. The data is then verified through an agreement among the peers and recorded in a chronologically encrypted ledger. The proposed system is implemented based on Hyperledger Fabric and the analysis thereof conducted by evaluating its processing speed, capacity, and security. The analysis indicates that the system is able to successfully intercept the transactions of unvalidated users, thereby preventing the recording of incorrect data by an unauthorized user. Furthermore, it provides a record of previously made changes to a learner's profile, thus improving the integrity and reliability of the data.

"As cryptographic tokens and altcoins are increasingly being built to serve as utility tokens, the notion of useful work consensus protocols is becoming ever more important. With useful work consensus protocols, users get rewards after they have carried out some specific tasks useful for the network. While in some cases the proof of some utility or service can be provided, the majority of tasks are impossible to verify reliably. To deal with such cases, we design “Proof-of-Prestige” (PoP)—a reward system that can run directly on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains or as a smart contract on top of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains. PoP introduces “prestige,” which is a volatile resource that, in contrast to coins, regenerates over time. Prestige can be gained by performing useful work, spent when benefiting from services, and directly translates to users minting power. Our scheme allows us to reliably reward decentralized workers while keeping the system free for the end-users. PoP is resistant against Sybil and collusion attacks and can be used with a vast range of unverifiable tasks. We build a simulator to assess the cryptoeconomic behavior of the system and deploy a full prototype of a content dissemination platform rewarding its participants. We implement the blockchain component on both Ethereum (PoW) and Cosmos (PoS), provide a mobile application, and connect it with our scheme with a negligible memory footprint. Finally, we adapt a fair exchange protocol allowing us to atomically exchange files for rewards also in scenarios where not all the parties have Internet connectivity. Our evaluation shows that even for large Ethereum traces, PoP introduces sub-millisecond computational overhead for miners in Cosmos and less than 0.013$ smart contract invocation cost for users in Ethereum.","[Michał Król, Alberto Sonnino, Mustafa Al-Bassam, Argyrios G.

"Urban crime is an ongoing problem in metropolitan development and attracts general concern from the international community. As an effective means of defending urban safety, crime prediction plays a crucial role in patrol force allocation and public safety. However, urban crime data is a macro result of crime patterns overlapped by various irrelevant factors that cause inhomogeneous noises—local outliers and irregular waves. These noises might obstruct the learning process of crime prediction models and result in a deviation of performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel paradigm of <underline>Du</underline>al-<underline>ro</underline>bust Enhanced Spatial-temporal Learning <underline>Net</underline>work (DuroNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that possesses an adaptive robustness for reducing the effect of outliers and waves. The robustness is mainly reflected on two aspects. One is a locality enhanced module that employs local temporal context information to smooth the deviation of outliers and dynamic spatial information to assist in understanding normal points. The other is a self-attention-based pattern representation module to weaken the effect of irregular waves by learning attentive weights. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world crime datasets before and after adding Gaussian noises. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our DuroNet over the state-of-the-art methods.","[Kaixi Hu, Lin Li, Jianquan Liu, Daniel Sun]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, Japan, China]",05 January 2021,5,"[Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, NEC Corporation, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan, CSIRO, Australia and University of New South Wales, Australia and Enhitech LLC, China]",January,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, NEC Corporation, CSIRO]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed45
"The vision for programmable matter is to create a material that can be reprogrammed to have different shapes and to change its physical properties on demand. They are autonomous systems composed of a huge number of independent connected elements called particles. The connections to one another form the overall shape of the system. These particles are capable of interacting with each other and take decisions based on their environment. Beyond sensing, processing, and communication capabilities, programmable matter includes actuation and motion capabilities. It could be deployed in different domains and will constitute an intelligent component of the IoT. A lot of applications can derive from this technology, such as medical or industrial applications. However, just like any other technology, security is a huge concern. Given its distributed architecture and its processing limitations, programmable matter cannot handle the traditional security protocols and encryption algorithms. This article proposes a new security protocol optimized and dedicated for IoT programmable matter. This protocol is based on lightweight cryptography and uses the same encryption protocol as a hashing function while keeping the distributed architecture in mind.

"The emergence of mobile service composition meets the current needs for real-time eCommerce. However, the requirements for eCommerce, such as safety and timeliness, are becoming increasingly strict. Thus, the cloud-edge hybrid computing model has been introduced to accelerate information processing, especially in a mobile scenario. However, the mobile environment is characterized by limited resource storage and users who frequently move, and these characteristics strongly affect the reliability of service composition running in this environment. Consequently, applications are likely to fail if inappropriate services are invoked. To ensure that the composite service can operate normally, traditional dynamic reconfiguration methods tend to focus on cloud services scheduling. Unfortunately, most of these approaches cannot support timely responses to dynamic changes. In this article, the cloud-edge based dynamic reconfiguration to service workflow for mobile eCommerce environments is proposed. First, the service quality concept is extended. Specifically, the value and cost attributes of a service are considered. The value attribute is used to assess the stability of the service for some time to come, and the cost attribute is the cost of a service invocation. Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict the stability of services, which is related to the calculation of the value attribute. Then, in view of the limited available equipment resources, a method for calculating the cost of calling a service is introduced. Third, candidate services are selected by considering both service stability and the cost of service invocation, thus yielding a dynamic reconfiguration scheme that is more suitable for the cloud-edge environment. Finally, a series of comparative experiments were carried out, and the experimental results prove that the method proposed in this article offers higher stability, less energy consumption, and more accurate service prediction.","[Honghao Gao, Wanqiu Huang, Yucong Duan]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China]",13 January 2021,13,"[School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, College of Information Science and Technology, Hainan University, China]",January,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer Engineering and Science, School of Computer Engineering and Science, College of Information Science and Technology]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed47
"The emergence of ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) environments has increased the risk of undesired access to individuals’ physical space or their information, anytime and anywhere, raising potentially serious privacy concerns. Individuals lack awareness and control of the vulnerabilities in everyday contexts and need support and care in regulating disclosures to their physical and digital selves. Existing GUI-based solutions, however, often feel physically interruptive, socially disruptive, time-consuming and cumbersome. To address such challenges, we investigate the user interaction experience and discuss the need for more tangible and embodied interactions for effective and seamless natural privacy management in everyday UbiComp settings. We propose the Privacy Care interaction framework, which is rooted in the literature of privacy management and tangible computing. Keeping users at the center, Awareness and Control are established as the core parts of our framework. This is supported with three interrelated interaction tenets: Direct, Ready-to-Hand, and Contextual. Direct refers to intuitiveness through metaphor usage. Ready-to-Hand supports granularity, non-intrusiveness, and ad hoc management, through periphery-to-center style attention transitions. Contextual supports customization through modularity and configurability. Together, they aim to provide experience of an embodied privacy care with varied interactions that are calming and yet actively empowering.

"Mobile apps have transformed many aspects of clinical practice and are becoming a commonplace in healthcare settings. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for such apps to play an important role in reducing the spread of the virus. Several types of COVID-19 apps have enabled healthcare professionals and governments to communicate with the public regarding the pandemic spread, coronavirus awareness, and self-quarantine measures. While these apps provide immense benefits for the containment of the spread, privacy and security of these digital tracing apps are at the center of public debate. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of a midwestern region in the United State to assess people’s attitudes toward such apps and to examine their privacy and security concerns and preferences. Survey results from 1,550 participants indicate that privacy/security protections and trust play a vital role in people’s adoption of such apps. Furthermore, results reflect users’ preferences wanting to have control over their personal information and transparency on how their data is handled. In addition, personal data protection priorities selected by the participants were surprising and yet revealing of the disconnect between technologists and users. In this article, we present our detailed survey results as well as design guidelines for app developers to develop innovative human-centered technologies that are not only functional but also respectful of social norms and protections of civil liberties. Our study examines users’ preferences for COVID-19 apps and integrates important factors of trust, willingness, and preferences in the context of app development.

"Consumer behavior plays a very important role in economics and targeted marketing. However, understanding economic consumer behavior is quite challenging, such as finding credible and reliable information on product profitability. Different from frequent pattern mining, utility-oriented mining integrates utility theory and data mining. Utility mining is a useful tool for understanding economic consumer behavior. Traditional algorithms for mining high-utility patterns (HUPs) applies a single/uniform minimum utility threshold (minutil) to obtain the set of HUPs, but in some real-life circumstances, some specific products may bring lower utilities compared with others, but their profit may offer some vital information. If minutil is set high, the patterns with low minutil are missed; if minutil is set low, the number of patterns becomes unmanageable. In this article, an efficient one-phase utility-oriented pattern mining algorithm, called HIMU, is proposed for mining HUPs with varied item-specific minimum utility. A novel tree structure called a multiple item utility set-enumeration tree (MIU-tree) and the global sorted and the conditional downward closure properties are introduced in HIMU. In addition, we extended the compact utility-list structure to keep the necessary information, and thus this one-phase HIMU model greatly reduces the computational costs and memory requirements. Moreover, two pruning strategies are then extended to enhance the performance. We conducted extensive experiments in several synthetic and real-world datasets; the results indicate that the designed one-phase HIMU algorithm can address the “rare item problem” and has better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of runtime, memory usage, and scalability. Furthermore, the enhanced algorithms outperform the non-optimized HIMU approach.","[Wensheng Gan, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin, Philippe Fournier-Viger, Han-Chieh Chao]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, Norway, China, Taiwan]",05 January 2021,5,"[Jinan University, China, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Norway, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), China, National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan]",January,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Jinan University, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), National Dong Hwa University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed4b

To tackle this challenge, this article presents a secure IoT scheme based on a fine-grained multi-receive signcryption scheme to realize end-to-end secure transmission and data access control. To enhance the security of online application decryption keys, we design a distributed threshold decryption scheme based on secret-sharing.

"Recently, due to the increase in popularity of the Internet, the problem of digital data security over the Internet is increasing at a phenomenal rate.

To achieve this, in this article, we propose a joint encryption then-compression based watermarking technique for digital document security. This technique offers a tool for confidentiality, copyright protection, and strong compression performance of the system. The proposed method involves three major steps as follows: (1) embedding of multiple watermarks through non-sub-sampled contourlet transform, redundant discrete wavelet transform, and singular value decomposition; (2) encryption and compression via SHA-256 and Lempel Ziv Welch (LZW), respectively; and (3) extraction/recovery of multiple watermarks from the possibly distorted cover image.

"With the explosive growth in the number of IoT devices, ensuring the integrity of the massive data generated by these devices has become an important issue. Due to the limitation of hardware, most past data integrity verification schemes randomly select partial data blocks and then perform integrity validation on those blocks instead of examining the entire dataset. This will result in that unsampled data blocks cannot be detected even if they are tampered with. To solve this problem, we propose a new and effective integrity auditing mechanism of sensor data based on a bilinear map accumulator. Using the proposed approach will examine all the data blocks in the dataset, not just some of the data blocks, thus, eliminating the possibility of any cloud manipulation. Compared with other schemes, our proposed solution has been proved to be highly secure for all necessary security requirements, including tag forgery, data deletion, replacement, replay, and data leakage attacks. The solution reduces the computational and storage costs of cloud storage providers and verifiers, and also supports dynamic operations for data owners to insert, delete, and update data by using a tag index table (TIT). Compared with existing schemes based on RSA accumulator, our scheme has the advantages of fast verification and witness generation and no need to map data blocks to prime numbers. The new solution supports all the characteristics of a data integrity verification scheme.","[Yongjun Ren, Jian Qi, Yepeng Liu, Jin Wang, Gwang-Jun Kim]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, Korea]",17 February 2021,17,"[School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science 8 Technology, Nanjing, China, School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science 8 Technology, Nanjing, China, School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science 8 Technology, Nanjing, China, School of Computer 8 Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science 8 Technology, Changsha, China, Chonnam National University, Dept. of Computer Engineering, 96-1 Mt, Dundeok-dong, Yeosu-si, Jeollanam-do, Gwangju, Korea]",February,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer and Software, School of Computer and Software, School of Computer and Software, School of Computer 8 Communication Engineering, Chonnam National University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed4e
"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is designed to refine and optimize the process controls, thereby leveraging improvements in economic benefits, such as efficiency and productivity. However, the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in an IIoT environment has problems such as low security and high cost. To overcome such issues, a mutual authentication scheme that is suitable for RFID systems, wherein techniques in Deep Learning (DL) are incorporated onto the Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function (APUF) for the secured access authentication of the IC circuits on the IoT, is proposed. The design applies the APUF-MPUF mutual authentication structure obtained by DL to generate essential real-time authentication information, thereby taking advantage of the feature that the tag in the PUF circuit structure does not need to store any essential information and resolving the problem of key storage. The proposed scheme also uses a bitwise comparison method, which hides the PUF response information and effectively reduces the resource overhead of the system during the verification process, to verify the correctness of the two strings. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has high robustness and security against different conventional attack methods, and the storage and communication costs are 95.7% and 42.0% lower than the existing schemes, respectively.","[Wei Liang, Songyou Xie, Dafang Zhang, Xiong Li, Kuan-ching Li]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, Taiwan]",22 October 2021,22,"[College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China, Institute for Cyber Security, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE), Providence University, Taiwan]",October,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Institute for Cyber Security, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE)]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed4f
"Nature-inspired optimization is one of the most prevalent research domains with a confounding history that fascinates the research communities. Particle Swarm Optimization is one of the well-known optimizers that belongs to the family of nature-inspired algorithms. It often suffers from premature convergence leading to a local optimum. To address this, several methods were presented using different network topologies of the particles, but either lacked accuracy or were slow. To solve these problems, an improved version of the Directed Weighted Complex Network Particle Swarm Optimization using the Genetic Algorithm (GDWCN-PSO) is presented. This method uses the concept of the Genetic Algorithm after each update to enhance convergence and diversity. Since most of the real-world applications and complex optimization problems involve more than one objective function so to suit this problem, a multiobjective version of GDWCN-PSO is also proposed and validated on standard benchmarks. To demonstrate its applicability in real-world applications, GDWCN-PSO is applied to solve the optimal key-based medical image encryption. It is one of the most challenging problems in health IoTs for protecting sensitive and confidential patient data as well as addressing the major concern of integrity and security of data in today’s advanced digital world.","[Vandana Bharti, Bhaskar Biswas, Kaushal Kumar Shukla]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[India, India, India]",24 May 2021,24,"[Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India]",May,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Indian Institute of Technology (BHU)]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed50
"This paper introduces and describes a novel architecture scenario based on Cloud Computing and counts on the innovative model of Federated Learning. The proposed model is named Integrated Federated Model, with the acronym InFeMo. InFeMo incorporates all the existing Cloud models with a federated learning scenario, as well as other related technologies that may have integrated use with each other, offering a novel integrated scenario. In addition to this, the proposed model is motivated to deliver a more energy efficient system architecture and environment for the users, which aims to the scope of data management. Also, by applying the InFeMo the user would have less waiting time in every procedure queue. The proposed system was built on the resources made available by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and by using the PaaS (Platform as a Service) model, in order to be able to handle user requests better and faster. This research tries to fill a scientific gap in the field of federated Cloud systems. Thus, taking advantage of the existing scenarios of FedAvg and CO-OP, we were keen to end up with a new federated scenario that merges these two algorithms, and aiming for a more efficient model that is able to select, depending on the occasion, if it “trains” the model locally in client or globally in server.","[Christos L.

"With the advent of mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) systems and its applications, the selection of the right crowd is gaining utmost importance. The increasing variability in the context of MCS tasks makes the selection of not only the capable but also the willing workers crucial for a high task completion rate. Most of the existing MCS selection frameworks rely primarily on reputation-based feedback mechanisms to assess the level of commitment of potential workers. Such frameworks select workers having high reputation scores but without any contextual awareness of the workers, at the time of selection, or the task. This may lead to an unfair selection of workers who will not perform the task. Hence, reputation on its own only gives an approximation of workers’ behaviors since it assumes that workers always behave consistently regardless of the situational context. However, following the concept of cross-situational consistency, where people tend to show similar behavior in similar situations and behave differently in disparate ones, this work proposes a novel recruitment system in MCS based on behavioral profiling. The proposed approach uses machine learning to predict the probability of the workers performing a given task, based on their learned behavioral models. Subsequently, a group-based selection mechanism, based on the genetic algorithm, uses these behavioral models in complementation with a reputation-based model to recruit a group of workers that maximizes the quality of recruitment of the tasks. Simulations based on a real-life dataset show that considering human behavior in varying situations improves the quality of recruitment achieved by the tasks and their completion confidence when compared with a benchmark that relies solely on reputation.","[Menatalla Abououf, Shakti Singh, Hadi Otrok, Rabeb Mizouni, Ernesto Damiani]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[UAE, UAE, UAE, UAE, UAE]",09 November 2021,9,"[Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE]",November,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Khalifa University, Khalifa University, Khalifa University, Khalifa University, Khalifa University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed52
"Privacy by Design (PbD) is the most common approach followed by software developers who aim to reduce risks within their application designs, yet it remains commonplace for developers to retain little conceptual understanding of what is meant by privacy. A vision is to develop an intelligent privacy assistant to whom developers can easily ask questions to learn how to incorporate different privacy-preserving ideas into their IoT application designs. This article lays the foundations toward developing such a privacy assistant by synthesising existing PbD knowledge to elicit requirements. It is believed that such a privacy assistant should not just prescribe a list of privacy-preserving ideas that developers should incorporate into their design. Instead, it should explain how each prescribed idea helps to protect privacy in a given application design context—this approach is defined as “Explainable Privacy.” A total of 74 privacy patterns were analysed and reviewed using ten different PbD schemes to understand how each privacy pattern is built and how each helps to ensure privacy. Due to page limitations, we have presented a detailed analysis in Reference [3]. In addition, different real-world Internet of Things (IoT) use-cases, including a healthcare application, were used to demonstrate how each privacy pattern could be applied to a given application design. By doing so, several knowledge engineering requirements were identified that need to be considered when developing a privacy assistant. It was also found that, when compared to other IoT application domains, privacy patterns can significantly benefit healthcare applications. In conclusion, this article identifies the research challenges that must be addressed if one wishes to construct an intelligent privacy assistant that can truly augment software developers’ capabilities at the design phase.","[Francesco Piccialli, Nik Bessis, Gwanggil Jeon, Calton Pu]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Italy, UK, South Korea, USA]",15 June 2021,15,"[University of Naples FEDERICO II, Italy, Edge Hill University, UK, Incheon National University, Incheon, South Korea, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA]",June,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,INTRODUCTION,"[University of Naples FEDERICO II, Edge Hill University, Incheon National University, Georgia Institute of Technology]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed53
"The growth of IoT technology, increasing prevalence of embedded devices, and advancements in biomedical technology have led to the emergence of numerous wearable health monitoring devices (WHMDs) in clinical settings and in the community. The majority of these devices are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled. Though the advantages offered by BLE-enabled WHMDs in tracking, diagnosing, and intervening with patients are substantial, the risk of cyberattacks on these devices is likely to increase with device complexity and new communication protocols. Furthermore, vendors face risk and financial tradeoffs between speed to market and ensuring device security in all situations. Previous research has explored the security and privacy of such devices by manually testing popular BLE-enabled WHMDs in the market and generally discussed categories of possible attacks, while mostly focused on IP devices. In this work, we propose a new semi-automated framework that can be used to identify and discover both known and unknown vulnerabilities in WHMDs. To demonstrate its implementation, we validate it with a number of commercially available BLE-enabled enabled wearable devices. Our results show that the devices are vulnerable to a number of attacks, including eavesdropping, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks. The proposed framework could therefore be used to evaluate potential devices before adoption into a secure network or, ideally, during the design and implementation of new devices.","[Ghazale Amel Zendehdel, Ratinder Kaur, Inderpreet Chopra, Natalia Stakhanova, Erik Scheme]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada]",14 September 2021,14,"[University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada, Cybersecurity Research Centre, Siemens Canada, Fredericton, Canada, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada]",September,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of New Brunswick, Cybersecurity Research Centre, University of New Brunswick, University of Saskatchewan, University of New Brunswick]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed54
"Data privacy is a very important issue. Especially in fields like medicine, it is paramount to abide by the existing privacy regulations to preserve patients’ anonymity. However, data is required for research and training machine learning models that could help gain insight into complex correlations or personalised treatments that may otherwise stay undiscovered. Those models generally scale with the amount of data available, but the current situation often prohibits building large databases across sites. So it would be beneficial to be able to combine similar or related data from different sites all over the world while still preserving data privacy. Federated learning has been proposed as a solution for this, because it relies on the sharing of machine learning models, instead of the raw data itself. That means private data never leaves the site or device it was collected on. Federated learning is an emerging research area, and many domains have been identified for the application of those methods. This systematic literature review provides an extensive look at the concept of and research into federated learning and its applicability for confidential healthcare datasets.","[Bjarne Pfitzner, Nico Steckhan, Bert Arnrich]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Germany, Germany, Germany]",02 June 2021,2,"[University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany]",June,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Potsdam, University of Potsdam, University of Potsdam]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed55

Power control technique is utilized to optimize the transmission power of both the source sensor and the MEC sensor to save energy. The remaining energy of the MEC sensor is concerned to ensure routine data transmission and jamming signal transmission.

"Federated Edge Learning (FEL) allows edge nodes to train a global deep learning model collaboratively for edge computing in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which significantly promotes the development of Industrial 4.0. However, FEL faces two critical challenges: communication overhead and data privacy. FEL suffers from expensive communication overhead when training large-scale multi-node models. Furthermore, due to the vulnerability of FEL to gradient leakage and label-flipping attacks, the training process of the global model is easily compromised by adversaries. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-efficient and privacy-enhanced asynchronous FEL framework for edge computing in IIoT. First, we introduce an asynchronous model update scheme to reduce the computation time that edge nodes wait for global model aggregation. Second, we propose an asynchronous local differential privacy mechanism, which improves communication efficiency and mitigates gradient leakage attacks by adding well-designed noise to the gradients of edge nodes. Third, we design a cloud-side malicious node detection mechanism to detect malicious nodes by testing the local model quality. Such a mechanism can avoid malicious nodes participating in training to mitigate label-flipping attacks. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can not only improve communication efficiency but also mitigate malicious attacks while its accuracy is comparable to traditional FEL frameworks.","[Yi Liu, Ruihui Zhao, Jiawen Kang, Abdulsalam Yassine, Dusit Niyato, Jialiang Peng]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, Canada, Singapore, China]",06 December 2021,6,"[School of Data Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University and Tencent Jarvis Lab, Heilongjiang, China, Tencent Jarvis Lab, Tencent, Shenzhen, China, Joint NTU-WeBank Research Centre on Fintech, Nanyang Technological University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, Lakehead University, Ontario, Canada, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, School of Data Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University, Heilongjiang, China]",December,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Data Science and Technology, Tencent Jarvis Lab, Joint NTU-WeBank Research Centre on Fintech, Lakehead University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Data Science and Technology]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed58

This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.","[Michell Boerger, Philipp Lämmel, Nikolay Tcholtchev, Manfred Hauswirth]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Germany, Germany, Germany, Germany]",22 December 2022,22,"[Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems, Berlin, Germany, Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems, Berlin, Germany, Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems, Berlin, Germany, Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany]",December,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems, Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems, Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems, Technical University of Berlin]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed5f
"The blockchain technology has been gaining an increasing popularity in the last years, and smart contracts are being used for a growing number of applications in several scenarios. The execution of smart contracts on public blockchains can be invoked by any user with a transaction, although in many scenarios there would be the need for restricting the right of executing smart contracts only to a restricted set of users. To help deal with this issue, this paper proposes a system based on a popular access control framework called RT, Role-based Trust Management, to regulate smart contracts execution rights. The proposed system, called L2DART (Layer 2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust management), implements the RT framework on a public blockchain, and it is designed as a layer-2 technology that involves both on-chain and off-chain functionalities to reduce the blockchain costs while keeping blockchain auditability, i.e., immutability and transparency. The on-chain costs of L2DART have been evaluated on Ethereum and compared with a previous solution implementing on-chain all the functionalities. The results show that the on-chain costs of L2DART are relatively low, making the system deployable in real-world scenarios.","[Andrea De Salve, Luca Franceschi, Andrea Lisi, Paolo Mori, Laura Ricci]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy]",19 September 2022,19,"[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - ISASI, Italy, University of Pisa, Italy, University of Pisa, Italy and Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - IIT, Italy, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - IIT, Italy, University of Pisa, Italy]",September,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - ISASI, University of Pisa, University of Pisa, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - IIT, University of Pisa]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed60
"Applying peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture to online video games has already attracted both academic and industrial interests, since it removes the need for expensive server maintenance. However, there are two major issues preventing the use of a P2P architecture, namely how to provide an effective distributed data storage solution, and how to tackle potential cheating behaviors. Inspired by emerging blockchain techniques, we propose a novel consensus model called Proof-of-Play (PoP) to provide a decentralized data storage system that incorporates an anti-cheating mechanism for P2P games, by rewarding players that interact with the game as intended, along with consideration of security measures to address the Nothing-at-stake Problem and the Long-range Attack. To validate our design, we utilize a game-theory model to show that under certain assumptions, the integrity of the PoP system would not be undermined due to the best interests of any user. Then, as a proof-of-concept, we developed a P2P game (Infinity Battle) to demonstrate how a game can be integrated with PoP in practice. Finally, experiments were conducted to study PoP in comparison with Proof-of-Work (PoW) to show its advantages in various aspects.","[Feijie Wu, Ho Yin Yuen, Henry C.B. Chan, Victor C.M.

"E-health is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for the healthcare related services. It uses various types of digital technologies and telecommunications, such as computers, sensing devices, Internet, and mobile devices to deliver medical services. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a communication environment optimized for low power devices (for example, health sensors and actuators) and operation on, in or around the human body (i.e., a patient). It can be used in various applications which are related to healthcare, such as “body automation”, “healthcare”, “medical monitoring”, “body interaction” and “medical implants (i.e., pacemaker)”. Most of the communications happen in IoMT based e-healthcare system are wireless in nature. This may cause severe threats to the security of the system. Various information security related attacks i.e., replay, man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM), impersonation, privileged insider, unauthorised session key computation, credentials leakage, stolen verifier, malware injection are possible in IoMT based e-healthcare system. These threats and attacks can create serious problems in the social life of an individual as this may reveal their confidential healthcare information to other unauthorised parties. Therefore, it is essential to propose an access control and key management scheme to secure the communication of a IoMT based e-healthcare system. Moreover, the security of such kind of scheme can also be enhanced through the deployment of a blockchain mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a blockchain enabled access control and key management protocol for IoMT based e-healthcare system which is named as “BACKM-EHA” in short. The security analysis of proposed BACKM-EHA is also provided through the standard i.e., “Real-Or-Random model”. The various conducted security analyses prove the security of BACKM-EHA against the different types of potential attacks. The performance of BACKM-EHA is better than the other existing schemes as it requires less communication cost, computation cost and provides more “security and functionality features”.","[Mohammad Wazid, Prosanta Gope]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[India, United Kingdom]",24 March 2022,24,"[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graphic Era Deemed to be University, India, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, United Kingdom]",March,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Computer Science]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed62
"Multi-organization data sharing is becoming increasing prevalent due to the interconnectivity of systems and the need for collaboration across organizations (e.g., exchange of data in a supply-chain involving multiple upstream and downstream vendors). There are, however, data security concerns due to lack of trust between organizations that may be located in jurisdictions with varying security and privacy legislation and culture (also referred to as a zero trust environment). Hence, in such a zero trust setting, one should introduce strengthened, yet efficient, access control mechanism to facilitate cross-organizational data access and exchange requests. Contemporary access control schemes generally focus on protecting a single objective rather than multiple parties, due to higher security costs. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme, designed to facilitate lightweight data sharing among different organizations. Specifically, our approach utilizes the consortium blockchain to establish a trustworthy environment, in which a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is then deployed using our proposed multi-signature protocol and smart contract methods. Evaluation of our proposed approach is performed on the HyperLedger Fabric consortium blockchain platform using both Caliper and BFT-SMaRT benchmarks, and the findings demonstrate the utility of our approach.","[Keke Gai, Yufeng She, Liehuang Zhu, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, Zhiguo Wan]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, USA, China]",18 July 2022,18,"[School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China and Yangtze Delta Region Academy of Beijing Institute of Technology, China, School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China, School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China, Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security, University of Texas at San Antonio, USA, Zhejiang Lab, China]",July,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security, Zhejiang Lab]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed63
"Blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a world with rapid development and implementations to change our everyday lives based on smart devices. These devices are attached to the internet that can communicate with each other without human interference. A well-known wireless network in blockchain-enabled IoT frameworks is the Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) that uses a novel protocol known as Routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) to provide effective and energy-efficient routing. LLNs that run on RPL are inherently prone to multiple Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the low cost, shared medium and resource-constrained nature of blockchain-enabled IoT devices. A Spam DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) attack is one of the novel attacks that drain the energy source of legitimate nodes and ends up causing the legitimate nodes to suffer from DoS. To address this problem, a mitigation scheme named DIS Spam Attack Mitigation (DISAM) is proposed. The proposed scheme effectively mitigates the effects of the Spam DIS attack on the network’s performance. The experimental results show that DISAM detects and mitigates the attack quickly and efficiently.","[Amjad Alsirhani, Muhammad Ali Khan*, Abdullah Alomari, Sauda Maryam, Aiman Younas, Muddesar Iqbal, Muhammad Hameed Siqqidi, Amjad Ali]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Canada, Pakistan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan]",28 March 2022,28,"[Jouf University, Sakaka Aljouf, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Canada, COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan, Albaha University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan, COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan, London South Bank University, United Kingdom, Jouf University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan]",March,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Jouf University, COMSATS University Islamabad, Albaha University, COMSATS University Islamabad, COMSATS University Islamabad, London South Bank University, Jouf University, COMSATS University Islamabad]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed64
"With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large-scale, heterogeneous, and dynamic distributed network has been formed among IoT devices. There is an extreme need to establish a trust mechanism between devices, and blockchain can provide a zero-trust security framework for IoT. However, the efficiency of the blockchain is far from meeting the application requirements of the IoT, which has become the biggest resistance to the application of the blockchain in the IoT. Therefore, this paper combines sharding to build an effective Blockchain-based IoT data storage scheme (S-BDS). Sharding can solve the problem of blockchain capacity and scalability. While the blockchain provides data immutability and traceability for the IoT, it also brings huge demand for data credibility verification. The communication delay in the IoT system seriously affects the security of the system, while the Merkle proof of traditional blockchain occupies a lot of communication resources. This paper constructs Insertable Vector Commitment (IVC) in the bilinear group and replaces the Merkle tree with IVC to store IoT data in the blockchain. The construct has small-sized proof. It also has the ability to record the number of updates, which can prevent replay-attacks. Experiments show that each block processes 1000 transactions, the proof size of a single data piece is 30% of the original scheme, and proofs from different shards can be aggregated. IVC can effectively reduce communication congestion and improve the stability and security of the IoT system.","[Jin Wang, Jiahao Chen, Neal Xiong, Osama Alfarraj, Amr Tolba, Yongjun Ren]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, USA, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, China]",12 February 2022,12,"[School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Fujian University of Technology; School of Computer & Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science & Technology, China, School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Fujian University of Technology, China, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Sul Ross State University, USA, Computer Science Department, Community College, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia, Computer Science Department, Community College, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia, School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, China]",February,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer Science and Mathematics, School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Computer Science Department, Computer Science Department, School of Computer and Software]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed65
"Recently, most of the Internet of things (IoT) infrastructures are highly centralized with single points of failure, which results in serious security and privacy issues of IoT data. Fortunately, blockchain technique can provide a decentralized and secure IoT framework to deal with security issues based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, openness, transparency and traceability. However, the blockchain consensus protocol guarantees the safety and reliability of data, but it also brings problems such as scalability limitations and poor storage extensibility, resulting in the inability to directly integrate blockchain and the IoT in existing conditions. In this paper, a private three-tier local blockchain, Three-tier architecture Blockchain (TBchain), is proposed to solve the problem by splitting part of the transactions in the public blockchain and locking them in a higher-level blockchain TBchain. Additionally, the private blockchain TBchain is connected to the public blockchain to build a hierarchical blockchain network to provide privacy protection for the IoT data stored on the blockchain. Finally, we implement an IoT framework based on TBchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to realize the decentralized IoT, which guarantees the user’s access control right to personal data. Experimental results show that the IoT framework based on TBchain and IPFS realizes the user’s access control right to personal data by verifying in advance to ensure the confidentiality and security of shared data, and improves the security and privacy of IoT data and transactions. Moreover, we prove that the scalability and storage extensibility of the blockchain is positively correlated with the number of data blocks in TBchain.","[Ying Li, Yaxin Yu, Xingwei Wang]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China]",05 September 2022,5,"[College of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, China, College of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, China, College of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, China]",September,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[College of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Computer Science and Engineering]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed66
"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication platform provides seamless information exchange facilities in a dynamic mobile city environment. Heterogeneous communication is a common medium for information exchange through autonomous resources distributed and accessed using infrastructure units. Cyber-Cyber-security is a primary concern in accessing autonomous information from the distributed resources due to anonymity and different types of targeted adversaries. This paper proposes token-based authorization and authentication (TAA) for securing IoV communications. The proposed method relies on blockchain technology and random forest learning for authorization and key management for authentication respectively. In this process, frequent chance in tokens and key update features are restricted in a view to maximize the seamlessness in information exchange. Authentication is preceded with the knowledge of the data classification without errors to prevent additional overhead. Blockchain based authorization helps to update specific fields of the tokens so as to retain the communication ratio by reducing vehicle-to-vehicle losses. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using appropriate simulations for the above discussed metrics by varying the vehicles density, error rate, and classification sets.","[Gunasekaran Manogaran, Bharat S.

"The transaction-rate bottleneck built into popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, leads to fee markets where transactions are included according to a first-price auction for block space.

In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries.

"In the inter-domain network, route leaks can disrupt the Internet traffic and cause large outages. The accurate detection of route leaks requires the sharing of AS business relationship information. However, the business relationship information between ASes is confidential. ASes are usually unwilling to reveal this information to the other ASes, especially their competitors. In this paper, we propose a method named FL-RLD to detect route leaks while maintaining the privacy of business relationships between ASes by using a blockchain-based federated learning framework, where ASes can collaboratively train a global detection model without directly disclosing their specific business relationships. To mitigate the lack of ground-truth validation data in route leaks, FL-RLD provides a self-validation scheme by labeling AS triples with local routing policies. We evaluate FL-RLD under a variety of datasets including imbalanced and balanced datasets, and examine different deployment strategies of FL-RLD under different topologies. According to the results, FL-RLD performs better in detecting route leaks than the single AS detection, whether the datasets are balanced or imbalanced. Additionally, the results indicate that selecting ASes with the most peers to first deploy FL-RLD brings more significant benefits in detecting route leaks than selecting ASes with the most providers and customers.","[Man Zeng, Dandan Li, Pei Zhang, Kun Xie, Xiaohong Huang]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[China],01 September 2022,1,"[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China]",September,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications],ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed69
"Edge networks are providing services for an increasing number of companies, and they can be used for communication between edge devices and edge gateways. However, the performance of edge devices varies greatly, and it is not easy to upgrade low-performance edge devices. Therefore, cyber attackers can use the vulnerability of edge devices to implement advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks. This paper proposes a network verification framework for edge networks that can minimize the upgrades needed to strengthen edge network security. First, the communication parties use the data transmitted by the given edge network. Our method uses our proposed PacketVerifier to attach verification information to the packet after it is sent and to verify and restore the packet before it reaches the receiver. Second, due to the performance requirements of edge networks, we design a new data processing structure, namely, a sliding window double ring (SWDR), to improve the performance of strict sequential protocols in parallel validation. Finally, experimental simulations show that our parallel processing algorithm has good performance in terms of network bandwidth compared with two existing packet processing algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed packet with verification information is compatible with the existing network topology, which helps PacketVerifier establish trustworthy transmission in a zero-trust environment.","[Zhenyu Li, Yong Ding, Honghao Gao, Bo Qu, Yujue Wang, Jun Li]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China, China]",24 March 2022,24,"[Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security School of Computer Science and Information Security Guilin University of Electronic Technology, China, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security School of Computer Science and Information Security Guilin University of Electronic Technology, China and Peng Cheng Laboratory, China, Shanghai University, China, Peng Cheng Laboratory, China, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security School of Computer Science and Information Security Guilin University of Electronic Technology, China, China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, China]",March,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security School of Computer Science and Information Security Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security School of Computer Science and Information Security Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Shanghai University, Peng Cheng Laboratory, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security School of Computer Science and Information Security Guilin University of Electronic Technology, China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed6a

"With the continuous increment of city volume and size, a number of traffic-related urban units (e.g., vehicles, roads, buildings, etc.) are emerging rapidly, which plays a heavy burden on the scientific traffic control of smart cities. In this situation, it is becoming a necessity to utilize the sensor data from massive cameras deployed at city crossings for accurate traffic flow prediction. However, the traffic sensor data are often distributed and stored by different organizations or parties with zero trust, which impedes the multi-party sensor data sharing significantly due to privacy concerns. Therefore, it requires challenging efforts to balance the tradeoff between data sharing and data privacy to enable cross-organization traffic data fusion and prediction. In light of this challenge, we put forward an accurate LSH (locality-sensitive hashing)-based traffic flow prediction approach with the ability to protect privacy. Finally, through a series of experiments deployed on a real-world traffic dataset, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency while guaranteeing sensor data privacy.","[Fan Wang, Guangshun Li, Yilei Wang, Wajid Rafique, Mohammad R.

"Unlike general routing strategies, network coding (NC) can combine encoding functions with multi-path propagation over a network. This allows network capacity to be achieved to support complex security solutions. Moreover, NC has intrinsic security advantages against passive attacks over traditional routing techniques. However, due to the transmission of the global encoding kernels, the system is fragile to eavesdropping attacks with multiple probes. This paper proposes a generic unicast secure transmission scheme based on random linear network coding (RLNC). Specifically, the intended receiver generates a random matrix upon receiving the request from the source node, and then transmits each row vector of this matrix over a link reversely to the source node. Each intermediate node rearranges all received vectors to form a matrix by row, and then post-multiplies its local encoding kernel by this matrix to obtain a new matrix. Similarly, each row vector of the new matrix is reversely transmitted over a link to the source node. This procedure is performed until we have the source node, where the generalized inverse of the received matrix (or part of it) can be used as its local encoding kernel. Hence, the intended receiver can use the generated matrix (or the corresponding part) to decode the received data packets directly. We also analyze the security to demonstrate that the proposed scheme is at least as secure as other methods against wiretapping attacks. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme to demonstrate its utility.","[Gunasekaran Manogaran, Hassan Qudrat-Ullah, Qin Xin, Latifur Khan]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[USA, Canada, Faroe Islands, USA]",14 May 2022,14,"[Howard University, Washington D.C., USA, York University, Toronto, Canada, University of the Faroe Islands, Faroe Islands, The University of Texas at Dallas, Texas, USA]",May,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,INTRODUCTION,"[Howard University, York University, University of the Faroe Islands, The University of Texas at Dallas]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed6e
"Internet of vehicles (IoVs) is a variant of vehicular ad hoc network, which provides an efficient communication method for vehicles. However, some traffic messages usually include sensitive identity information, which is easy to bring about the leakage of vehicular identities during data communications. Further, if vehicular identities are fully protected, then it can lead to trusted authority cannot reveal the real identities of malicious vehicles, which incurs more security issues in IoVs. Therefore, in this article, we propose an efficient conditional identity privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on cooperation of multiple fog servers under fog computing-based IoVs, where fog servers are used to verify (authenticate) the legitimacy of vehicles without revealing their real identities. Further, an associated vehicular identity updating mechanism is constructed to solve the problem that some compromised fog servers may leak their stored verification information to pool real vehicular identities. Additionally, a malicious vehicular identity tracing mechanism is proposed to support related fog servers that receive signed false messages can trace the real identities of malicious vehicles.

Although representing and reasoning about norms, policies, and preferences is crucial to ensuring that autonomous agents act in a manner that satisfies stakeholder requirements, normative concepts, policies, and preferences have yet to be considered as first-class abstractions in Web-based multiagent systems. Towards this end, this article motivates the need for alignment and joint research across the Multiagent Systems, Semantic Web, and WoT communities, introduces a conceptual framework for governance of autonomous agents on the Web, and identifies several research challenges and opportunities.","[Timotheus Kampik, Adnane Mansour, Olivier Boissier, Sabrina Kirrane]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[Sweden, France, France, Austria]",14 November 2022,14,"[Umeniversity, Ume, Sweden, Mines Saint-Étienne, France, Mines Saint-Étienne, France, Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Vienna, Austria]",November,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Internet Technology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Umeniversity, Mines Saint-Étienne, Mines Saint-Étienne, Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed70
"In this article, we focus on the problem of learning a Bayesian network over distributed data stored in a commodity cluster. Specifically, we address the challenge of computing the scoring function over distributed data in an efficient and scalable manner, which is a fundamental task during learning. While exact score computation can be done using the MapReduce-style computation, our goal is to compute approximate scores much faster with probabilistic error bounds and in a scalable manner. We propose a novel approach, which is designed to achieve the following: (a) decentralized score computation using the principle of gossiping; (b) lower resource consumption via a probabilistic approach for maintaining scores using the properties of a Markov chain; and (c) effective distribution of tasks during score computation (on large datasets) by synergistically combining well-known hashing techniques. We conduct theoretical analysis of our approach in terms of convergence speed of the statistics required for score computation, and memory and network bandwidth consumption. We also discuss how our approach is capable of efficiently recomputing scores when new data are available. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our approach and compared with the MapReduce-style computation using datasets of different characteristics on a 16-node cluster. When the MapReduce-style computation provided exact statistics for score computation, it was nearly 10 times slower than our approach. Although it ran faster on randomly sampled datasets than on the entire datasets, it performed worse than our approach in terms of accuracy. Our approach achieved high accuracy (below 6% average relative error) in estimating the statistics for approximate score computation on all the tested datasets. In conclusion, it provides a feasible tradeoff between computation time and accuracy for fast approximate score computation on large-scale distributed data.","[Anas Katib, Praveen Rao, Kobus Barnard, Charles Kamhoua]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[MO, MO, AZ, MD]",13 March 2019,13,"[University of Missouri-Kansas City, MO, University of Missouri-Kansas City, MO, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, Army Research Lab, Adelphi, MD]",March,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data,Q1,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Missouri-Kansas City, University of Missouri-Kansas City, University of Arizona, Army Research Lab]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ed71

"This study analyzes cybersecurity trends and proposes a conceptual framework to identify cybersecurity topics of social interest and emerging topics that need to be addressed by researchers in the field. The insights drawn from this framework allow for a more proactive approach to identifying cybersecurity patterns and emerging threats that will ultimately improve the collective cybersecurity posture of the modern society. To achieve this, cybersecurity-oriented content in both media and academic corpora, disseminated between 2008 and 2018, were morphologically analyzed via text mining. A total of 3,556 academic papers obtained from the top-10 highly reputable cybersecurity academic conferences, and 4,163 news articles collected from the New York Times were processed. The LDA topic modeling followed optimal perplexity and coherence scores resulted in 12 trendy topics. Next, the time-based gap between these trendy topics was analyzed to measure the correlation between media and trendy academic topics. Both convergences and divergences between the two cybersecurity corpora were identified, suggesting a strong time-based correlation between these resources. This framework demonstrates the effective use of automated techniques to provide insights about cybersecurity topics of social interest and emerging trends and informs the direction of future academic research in this field.","[Mahdi R.

"Blockchain records transactions with various protection techniques against tampering. To meet the requirements on cooperation and anonymity of companies and organizations, researchers have developed a few solutions. Ring signature-based schemes allow multiple participants cooperatively to manage while preserving their individuals’ privacy. However, the solutions cannot work properly due to the increased computing complexity along with the expanded group size. In this article, we propose a Multi-center Anonymous Blockchain-based (MAB) system, with joint management for the consortium and privacy protection for the participants. To achieve that, we formalize the syntax used by the MAB system and present a general construction based on a modular design. By applying cryptographic primitives to each module, we instantiate our scheme with anonymity and decentralization. Furthermore, we carry out a comprehensive formal analysis of our exemplified scheme. A proof of concept simulation is provided to show the feasibility.

"Technology trend analysis uses data relevant to historical performance and extrapolates it to estimate and assess the future potential of technology. Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain. This study uses a design science research methodology, a text mining technique, and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the development trends concerning the presentation of the product or service information on a company's website. This study applies regulatory technology (RegTech) as a case to analyze and justify the emerging cross-disciplinary trend. Furthermore, an experimental study is conducted using the Google search engine to verify and validate the proposed research mechanism at the end of this study. The study results reveal that, compared with Google Trends and Google Correlate, the research mechanism proposed in this study is more illustrative, feasible, and promising because it reduces noise and avoids the additional time and effort required to perform a further in-depth exploration to obtain the information.","[Shi Ming Huang, David C.

"Interfirm relationships are crucial to our understanding of firms’ collective and interactive behavior. Many information systems-related phenomena, including the diffusion of innovations, standard alliances, technology collaboration, and outsourcing, involve a multitude of relationships between firms. This study proposes a latent space approach to model temporal change in a dual-view interfirm network. We assume that interfirm relationships depend on an underlying latent space; firms that are close to each other in the latent space are more likely to develop a relationship. We construct the latent space by embedding two dynamic networks of firms in an integrated manner, resulting in a more comprehensive view of an interfirm relationship. We validate our approach by introducing three business measures derived from the latent space model to study alliance formation and stock comovement. We illustrate how the trajectories of firms provide insights into alliance activities. We also show that our proposed measures have strong predictive power on stock comovement. We believe the proposed approach enriches the methodology toolbox of IS researchers in studying interfirm relationships.","[Ka Chung Ng, Mike K. P.

"A key challenge in engineering distributed systems consists in the integration into their development of a decentralised infrastructure allowing the system participants to trust each other. In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.","[Flavio Corradini, Alessandro Marcelletti, Andrea Morichetta, Andrea Polini, Barbara Re, Francesco Tiezzi]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Management Information Systems (Q1),"[Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy]",11 February 2022,11,"[University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy, University of Florence, Florence, Italy]",February,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,Q1,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Camerino, University of Camerino, University of Camerino, University of Camerino, University of Camerino, University of Florence]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed78
"In the United States and around the world, gun violence has become a long-standing public safety concern and a security threat, due to violent gun-related crimes, injuries, and fatalities. While legislators and lawmakers have attempted to mitigate its threats through legislation, research on gun violence confirms the need for a comprehensive approach to gun violence prevention. This entails addressing the problem in as many ways as possible, such as through legislation, new technological advancements, re-engineering supply, and administrative protocols, and so on. The research focuses on the technological, supply, and administrative aspects, in which we propose a manner of managing gun-related data efficiently from the point of manufacture/sale, as well as at points of transfers between secondary sellers for the improvement of criminal investigation processes. Making data more readily available with greater integrity will facilitate successful investigations and prosecutions of gun crimes. Currently, there is no single and uniform platform for firearm manufacturers, dealers, and other stakeholders involved in firearm sales, dissemination, management, and investigation. With the help of Blockchain technology, gun registry, ownership, transfers, and, most importantly, investigations, when crimes occur, can all be managed efficiently, breaking the cycle of gun violence. The identification of guns, gun tracing, and identification of gun owners/possessors rely on accuracy, integrity, and consistency in related systems to influence gun crime investigation processes. Blockchain technology, which uses a consensus-based approach to improve processes and transactions, is demonstrated in this study as a way to enhance these procedures. This is the first study to explore and demonstrate the utility of Blockchain for gun-related criminal investigations using a design science approach.","[Patricia Akello, Naga Vemprala, Nicole Beebe, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Management Information Systems (Q1),"[, , , ]",14 November 2022,14,"[University of Montana, University of Portland, The University of Texas at San Antonio, The University of Texas at San Antonio]",November,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,Q1,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Montana, University of Portland, The University of Texas at San Antonio, The University of Texas at San Antonio]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed79
"The use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been gaining traction in recent years due to various reasons. While charging their EVs, users expose their identity and personal details, and an adversary being able to identify and track where users charge their EVs is a potential privacy threat. In this article, we propose a user-empowered privacy-preserving authentication protocol for EV charging based on Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) to provide Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-security. The proposed method gives users full control over their identities and allows them to remain anonymous while charging from any station. Giving control over their identities empowers users. At the same time, by making use of the concept of VC, other parties can verify that a user is legitimate and authenticate the user before providing charging services. Hence, the proposed protocol makes the charging service available in a secure way, while empowering users and preserving their privacy.","[Rohini Poolat Parameswarath, Prosanta Gope, Biplab Sikdar]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Management Information Systems (Q1),"[Singapore, UK, Singapore]",10 August 2022,10,"[Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore]",August,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,Q1,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Department of Computer Science, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed7a
"In Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) environments, the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing paradigm can provide a more proper solution to deploy scientific workflows compared to cloud computing or other traditional distributed computing. Owing to the different sizes of scientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it is essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data transmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge computing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the dynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and exiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To address this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model that includes shared datasets within the individual and among multiple workflows across various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement strategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the build-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to proper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution problem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning–based approach to learn the data placement strategy in the runtime stage of scientific workflows. Through using the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing architecture to simulate IoT environments, we designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of DYM-RL-DPS. The results of our strategy can effectively reduce the data transmission time as compared to other strategies.","[Xin Du, Songtao Tang, Zhihui Lu, Keke Gai, Jie Wu, Patrick C. K.

"In the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, all entities in the IoT network, whether home users or industrial things, receive data from other things to make decisions. However, in the decentralized, heterogeneous, and rapidly changing IoT network with billions of devices, deciding about where to get the services or information from is critical, especially because malicious entities can exist in such an unmanaged network. Security provisioning alone cannot solve the issue of service quality or reliability. One way to elevate security and reliability in the IoT network is to bridge the gap of trust between objects, and also between humans and objects, while taking into account the IoT network characteristics. Therefore, a proper trust management system must be established on top of the IoT network service architecture. Trust is related to the manner expected from objects in providing services and recommendations. Recommendations are the basis of decision making in every trust management system. Since trust management ideas in the IoT are still immature, the purpose of this article is to survey, analyze, and compare the approaches that have been taken in building trust management systems for the IoT. We break down the features of such systems by analysis and also do quantitative comparisons by simulation. This article is organized into two main parts. First, studies and approaches in this field are compared from four perspectives: (1) trust computation method, (2) resistance to attacks (3) adherence to the limitations of IoT networks and devices, and (4) performance of the trust management scheme. The second part is quantitative and simulates four major methods in this field and measures their performance. We also make extensive analytical comparisons to demonstrate the similarities and discrepancies of current IoT trust management schemes and extract the essence of a resilient trust management framework.","[Maryam Ebrahimi, Mohammad Hesam Tadayon]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Management Information Systems (Q1),"[Iran, Iran]",13 April 2022,13,"[Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC), Tehran, Iran, Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC), Tehran, Iran]",April,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,Q1,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC), Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC)]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed7c

"This investigation focuses on the application of computational intelligence to the security of Digital Twins (DTs) graphic data of the Cyber-physical System (CPS). The intricate and diverse physical space of CPS in the smart city is mapped in virtual space to construct the DTs CPS in the smart city. Besides, Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph-Big Multigraph (DPFS-BM) is employed to ensure data privacy security. Moreover, the analysis and prediction model for the DTs big graphic data (BGD) in the CPS is built based on Differential Privacy-AlexNet (DP-AlexNet). Alexnet successfully solves the gradient dispersion problem of the Sigmoid function of deep network structures. Finally, the comparative analysis approach is utilized to verify the performance of the model reported here by comparing it with Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, original AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron in a simulation experiment. Through the comparison in the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, the mean absolute percentage error, training time, and test time, the model proposed here outperforms other models regarding errors, time delay, and time consumption. In the same environment, the system performs better with multi-hop paths, extra relays, and a high fading index; in that case, the outage probability is minimal. Therefore, the DP-AlexNet model is suitable for processing BGD. Moreover, its speed acceleration is more apparent than that of other models, with a higher SpeedUp indicator. The research effectively combines data mining and data security, which is of significant value for optimizing the privacy protection technology of frequent subgraph mining on a single multi-graph. Besides, the constructed DTs of CPS can provide excellent accuracy and a prominent acceleration effect on the premise of low errors.

"For Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications, reliable autonomous driving systems usually perform the majority of their computations on the cloud due to the limited computing power of edge devices. The communication delay between cloud platforms and edge devices, however, can cause dangerous consequences, particularly for latency-sensitive object detection tasks. Object detection tasks are also vulnerable to significantly degraded model performance caused by unknown objects, which creates unsafe driving conditions. To address these problems, this study develops an orchestrated system that allows real-time object detection and incrementally learns unknown objects in a complex and dynamic environment. A YOLO-based object detection model in edge computing mode uses thermal images to detect objects accurately in poor lighting conditions. In addition, an attention mechanism improves the system’s performance without significantly increasing model complexity. An unknown object detector (UOD) automatically classifies and labels unknown objects without direct supervision on edge devices, while a roadside unit (RSU)-based mechanism is developed to update classes and ensure a secure driving experience for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the interactions between edge devices, RSU servers, and the cloud are designed to allow efficient collaboration.

"As the demand for taxi reservation services has increased, increasing the income of taxi drivers with advanced services has attracted attention. In this article, we propose a path decision framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information. The goal is to optimize a taxi driver's profit when considering a reservation. Our framework contains four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information for speeding up the search process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide proper search directions for recommending cruising locations. One module of the taxi demand prediction is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose the H* (Heuristic-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function to dynamically recommend next cruising locations. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset have shown that our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in H* can decrease the computing time and allow the search process to be more efficient.

"As timing delay becomes a critical issue in chip performance, there is a burning desire for IC design under smart manufacturing to optimize the delay. As the best connection model for multi-terminal nets, the wirelength and the maximum source-to-sink pathlength of the Steiner minimum tree are the decisive factors of timing delay for routing. In addition, considering that X-routing can get the utmost out of routing resources, this article proposes a Timing-Driven X-routing Steiner Minimum Tree (TD-XSMT) algorithm based on two-stage competitive particle swarm optimization. This work utilizes the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and redesigns its framework, thus improving its performance. First, a two-stage learning strategy is presented, which balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the particle by learning edge structures and pseudo-Steiner point choices. Especially in the second stage, a hybrid crossover strategy is designed to guarantee convergence quality.

Finally, according to the characteristics of the discrete TD-XSMT problem, the mutation and crossover operators of the genetic algorithm are used to effectively discretize the proposed algorithm. Experimental results reveal that TSCPSO-TD-XSMT can obtain a smooth trade-off between wirelength and maximum source-to-sink pathlength, and achieve distinguished timing delay optimization.","[Genggeng Liu, Ruping Zhou, Saijuan Xu, Yuhan Zhu, Wenzhong Guo]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Management Information Systems (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China]",10 August 2022,10,"[Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China, Fujian Business University, Fuzhou, China, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China]",August,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,Q1,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Fuzhou University, Fuzhou University, Fujian Business University, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed81
"In this work, we introduce DIRECTGO, a new MATLAB toolbox for derivative-free global optimization. DIRECTGO collects various deterministic derivative-free DIRECT-type algorithms for box-constrained, generally constrained, and problems with hidden constraints. Each sequential algorithm is implemented in two ways: using static and dynamic data structures for more efficient information storage and organization. Furthermore, parallel schemes are applied to some promising algorithms within DIRECTGO. The toolbox is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring the user-friendly use of all functionalities available in DIRECTGO. Available features are demonstrated in detailed computational studies using a comprehensive DIRECTGOLib v1.0 library of global optimization test problems. Additionally, 11 classical engineering design problems illustrate the potential of DIRECTGO to solve challenging real-world problems. Finally, the appendix gives examples of accompanying MATLAB programs and provides a synopsis of its use on the test problems with box and general constraints.","[Linas Stripinis, Remigijus Paulavičius]",Applied Mathematics (Q2); Software (Q2),"[Lithuania, Lithuania]",19 December 2022,19,"[Vilnius University Institute of Data Science and Digital Technologies, Akademijos, Vilnius, Lithuania, Vilnius University Institute of Data Science and Digital Technologies, Akademijos, Vilnius, Lithuania]",December,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software,Q2,ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Vilnius University Institute of Data Science and Digital Technologies, Vilnius University Institute of Data Science and Digital Technologies]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed82
"Distributed ledgers (DLs) provide many advantages over centralized solutions in Internet of Things projects, including but not limited to improved security, transparency, and fault tolerance. To leverage DLs at scale, their well-known limitation (i.e., performance) should be adequately analyzed and addressed. Directed acyclic graph-based DLs have been proposed to tackle the performance and scalability issues by design. The first among them, IOTA, has shown promising signs in addressing the preceding issues. IOTA is an open source DL designed for the Internet of Things. It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, to achieve a potentially higher scalability over blockchain-based DLs. However, due to the uncertainty and centralization of the deployed consensus, the current IOTA implementation exposes some performance issues, making it less performant than the initial design. In this article, we first extend an existing simulator to support realistic IOTA simulations and investigate the impact of different design parameters on IOTA’s performance. Then, we propose a layered model to help the users of IOTA determine the optimal waiting time to resend the previously submitted but not yet confirmed transaction. Our findings reveal the impact of the transaction arrival rate, tip selection algorithms, weighted tip selection algorithm randomness, and network delay on the throughput. Using the proposed layered model, we shed some light on the distribution of the confirmed transactions. The distribution is leveraged to calculate the optimal time for resending an unconfirmed transaction to the DL. The performance analysis results can be used by both system designers and users to support their decision making.","[Caixiang Fan, Sara Ghaemi, Hamzeh Khazaei, Yuxiang Chen, Petr Musilek]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q2); Media Technology (Q2); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q3); Information Systems (Q3); Software (Q3)","[Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada]",02 December 2021,2,"[University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada]",December,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computing Systems,Q2,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computing Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Alberta, University of Alberta, York University, University of Alberta, University of Alberta]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed83

This result, however, holds only for distributed tasks such that the correctness of their solutions can be locally checked by a deterministic algorithm. In this article, we extend the result of Naor and Stockmeyer to a wider class of tasks.

"Smart contracts are tempting targets of attacks, since they often hold and manipulate significant financial assets, are immutable after deployment, and have publicly available source code, with assets estimated in the order of millions of US Dollars being lost in the past due to vulnerabilities. Formal verification is thus a necessity, but smart contracts challenge the existing highly efficient techniques routinely applied in the symbolic verification of software, due to specificities not present in general programming languages. A common feature of existing works in this area is the attempt to reuse off-the-shelf verification tools designed for general programming languages. This reuse can lead to inefficiency and potentially unsound results, since domain translation is required. In this paper we describe a carefully crafted approach that directly models the central aspects of smart contracts natively, going from the contract to its logical representation without intermediary steps. We use the expressive and highly automatable logic of constrained Horn clauses for modeling and we instantiate our approach to the Solidity language. A tool implementing our approach, called Solicitous, was developed and integrated into the SMTChecker module of the Solidity compiler solc. We evaluated our approach on an extensive benchmark set containing 22446 real-world smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain over a 27 months period. The results show that our approach is able to establish safety of significantly more contracts than comparable, publicly available verification tools, with an order of magnitude increase in the percentage of formally verified contracts.","[Rodrigo Otoni, Matteo Marescotti, Leonardo Alt, Patrick Eugster]","Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1)","[Switzerland, UK, Switzerland, USA]",28 September 2022,28,"[Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland, Meta, UK, Ethereum Foundation, Switzerland, Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland and Purdue University, USA]",September,ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security,Q1,ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Università della Svizzera italiana, Meta, Ethereum Foundation, Università della Svizzera italiana]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed88

"Data exchange between organizations is becoming an increasingly significant issue due to the great opportunities it presents. However, there is great reluctance to share if data sovereignty is not provided. Providing it calls for not only access control but also usage control implemented in distributed systems. Access control is a research field where there has been a great deal of work, but usage control, especially implemented in distributed systems as Distributed Usage Control (DUC), is a very new field of research that presents great challenges. Moreover, little is known about what challenges must really be faced and how they must be addressed. This is evidenced by the fact that existing research has focused non-specifically on different features of DUC, which are not formalized. Therefore, the path for the development of DUC solutions is unclear and it is difficult to analyze the scope of data sovereignty attained by the wide range of DUC solutions. In this context, this article is based on an initial in-depth analysis of DUC related work. In it, the challenges posed by DUC in terms of data sovereignty and the features that must be provided to address them are identified and analyzed for the first time. Based on these features, an initial DUC framework is proposed to assess in a practical and unified way the extent to which DUC solutions provide data sovereignty. Finally, the assessment framework is applied to compare the scopes of the most widespread DUC solutions and identify their limitations.","[Gonzalo Gil, Aitor Arnaiz, Mariví Higuero, Francisco Javier Diez]","Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1)","[Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain]",11 November 2022,11,"[TEKNIKER, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Eibar, Spain, TEKNIKER, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Eibar, Spain, Escuela de Ingeniería de Bilbao (UPV/EHU), Bilbao, Spain, TEKNIKER, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Eibar, Spain]",November,ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security,Q1,ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[TEKNIKER, TEKNIKER, Escuela de Ingeniería de Bilbao (UPV/EHU), TEKNIKER]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed8a

"Blockchain platforms are coming into use for processing critical transactions among participants who have not established mutual trust. Many blockchains are programmable, supporting smart contracts, which maintain persistent state and support transactions that transform the state. Unfortunately, bugs in many smart contracts have been exploited by hackers. Obsidian is a novel programming language with a type system that enables static detection of bugs that are common in smart contracts today. Obsidian is based on a core calculus, Silica, for which we proved type soundness. Obsidian uses typestate to detect improper state manipulation and uses linear types to detect abuse of assets. We integrated a permissions system that encodes a notion of ownership to allow for safe, flexible aliasing. We describe two case studies that evaluate Obsidian’s applicability to the domains of parametric insurance and supply chain management, finding that Obsidian’s type system facilitates reasoning about high-level states and ownership of resources. We compared our Obsidian implementation to a Solidity implementation, observing that the Solidity implementation requires much boilerplate checking and tracking of state, whereas Obsidian does this work statically.","[Michael Coblenz, Reed Oei, Tyler Etzel, Paulette Koronkevich, Miles Baker, Yannick Bloem, Brad A.

"Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms that restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.","[Michael P.

"How to combine multiple data-streams for transmission in aggregate is a very interesting problem, especially for the emerging software-defined networks nowadays. The conventional packet-based protocols cannot provide the flexibility for combining data-streams in the ad hoc nature. If the number of data-streams changes over time, the existing packet formats cannot handle the transmission of multiple data-streams effectively. The effectiveness is measured by two performance metrics, namely coding efficiency and data-transmission intermittency. We propose a new software-defined multiplexing code (SDMC) approach, which can combine (multiplex) multiple data-streams easily and is much more effective than the conventional packet-based method. Three SDMC schemes (distributed, hierarchical, and hybrid) are compared theoretically and by simulation. A trade-off between these two performance metrics can be found when one selects one of the three SDMC schemes for combining multiple data-streams.

"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables numerous in-vehicle applications for smart cities, driving increasing service demands for processing various contents (e.g., videos). Generally, for efficient service delivery, the contents from the service providers are processed on the edge servers (ESs), as edge computing offers vehicular applications low-latency services. However, due to the reusability of the same contents required by different distributed vehicular users, processing the copies of the same contents repeatedly in an edge server leads to a waste of resources (e.g., storage, computation, and bandwidth) in ESs. Therefore, it is a challenge to provide high-quality services while guaranteeing the resource efficiency with edge content caching. To address the challenge, an edge content caching method for smart cities with service requirement prediction, named E-Cache, is proposed. First, the future service requirements from the vehicles are predicted based on the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet). Then, preliminary content caching schemes are elaborated based on the predicted service requirements, which are further adjusted by a many-objective optimization aiming at minimizing the execution time and the energy consumption of the vehicular services. Eventually, experimental evaluations prove the efficiency and effectiveness of E-Cache with spatiotemporal traffic trajectory big data.","[Xiaolong Xu, Zijie Fang, Jie Zhang, Qiang He, Dongxiao Yu, Lianyong Qi, Wanchun Dou]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, China, Australia, China, China, China]",21 June 2021,21,"[School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China and Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia, School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Shandong, China, School of Information Science and Engineering, Qufu Normal University, Shandong, China, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China]",June,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,Q1,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer and Software, School of Computer and Software, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, School of Computer Science and Technology, School of Information Science and Engineering, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed90

"Internet of Vehicles(IoV) enables vehicles to generate and share messages to improve transportation safety and efficiency, especially in a smart city scenario where modern communication technology is utilized.

"The microgrid (MG) is a complicated cyber-physical system that operates based on interactions between physical processes and computational components, which make it vulnerable to varied cyber-attacks. In this paper, the impact of data integrity attack (DIA) has been considered, as one of the most dangerous cyber threats to MGs, on the steady-state operation of hybrid MGs (HMGs). Additionally, a novel method based on sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) approach, is proposed to detect DIA on the renewable energy sources’ metering infrastructure and improve the data security within the HMGs. The proposed method generates a binary sample, which is used to compute a test statistic that is further used against two thresholds to decide among three alternatives.

Also, to evaluate the effect of DIA on the operation of the HMGs, DIAs with different severities are launched on the measured power generation of renewable energy resources (RESs) like wind turbine (WT).

"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought unprecedented opportunities to meet massive behavioral data access and personalization requirements for Internet of Behavior (IoB).

Firstly, we analyze the network model and establish a task cost function based on processing delay and energy consumption. Secondly, we define a Distributed Optimization Problem (DOP) to maximize individual utilities and system utility, which is proved to be a potential countermeasure. Thirdly, we conduct Markov modeling for the current offloading strategy-making scheme and define the objectives and constraints of the optimization function. At the same time, the SA is introduced into the DQN Algorithm, which improves the capacity of the algorithm by focusing on the exploration in the early stage and following the experience value in the later stage.

"The changing vulnerability and threat landscape constantly challenge the security of wireless communication standards and protocols. For the Internet of Things (IoT), LoRaWAN is one of the dominant technologies for urban environments, industrial settings, or critical infrastructures due to its low-power and long-range capabilities. LoRaWAN IoT deployments are expected to operate for multiple years or even decades. Hence, it is imperative to maintain operational security at all times while continuously evolving the security of the standard and its implementations. We survey LoRaWAN security and follow a systematic and evolvable approach that can be dynamically updated. To this end, we propose a novel methodology to create evolvable surveys which relate the analyzed critical security concepts, thus allowing IT security experts to reason about LoRaWAN security properties over time.

"As a critical branch of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the medicine industry, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) significantly improves the quality of healthcare due to its real-time monitoring and low medical cost. Benefiting from edge and cloud computing, IoMT is provided with more computing and storage resources near the terminal to meet the low-delay requirements of computation-intensive services. However, the service offloading from health monitoring units (HMUs) to edge servers generates additional energy consumption. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI), which has developed rapidly in recent years, has proved effective in some resource allocation applications. Taking both energy consumption and delay into account, we propose an energy-aware service offloading algorithm under an end-edge-cloud collaborative IoMT system with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), named ECAC. Technically, ECAC uses the structural similarity between the natural distributed IoMT system and A3C, whose parameters are asynchronously updated. Besides, due to the typical delay-sensitivity mechanism and time-energy correction, ECAC can adjust dynamically to the diverse service types and system requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of ECAC for IoMT is proved on real data.","[Jielin Jiang, Jiajie Guo, Maqbool Khan, Yan Cui, Wenmin Lin]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[China, China, Pakistan, China, China]",29 August 2022,29,"[School of Computer and Software, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China and The State Key Lab. for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China, School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China, Software Competence Center Hagenberg GmbH, Softwarepark, Austria and SPCAI, Pak-Austria Fachhochschule-Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, College of Mathematics and Information Science, Nanjing Normal University of Special Education, China, Institute of VR and Intelligent System, Alibaba Business School, Hangzhou Normal University, China]",August,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,Q1,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer and Software, School of Computer and Software, Software Competence Center Hagenberg GmbH, College of Mathematics and Information Science, Institute of VR and Intelligent System]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed98
"Internet of Things (IoT) is progressively becoming an essential aspect of daily life that can be sensed anywhere and anytime, transforming the traditional lifestyle into a high-tech one. Numerous applications in the edge are brought to life based on IoT infrastructures. Especially, edge computing has witnessed the proliferation and impact of IoT-enabled devices benefiting from the data collection and computation capabilities of IoT. However, establishing an IoT from scratch can be monetarily expensive, and leasing the existing sub-networks confronts the potentially dishonest behavior of service providers. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework of leasing edge IoT networks and analyze the influence of sub-network owners’ dishonest behavior on the network. We model the interaction between the edge user and the owners of sub-networks by a Stackelberg game with a unique equilibrium, jointly analyzing the pricing and data collection mechanisms. The Primal-dual Decomposition algorithm and its theoretical analyses are provided for the corresponding strategies of the edge user and sub-network owners. Evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in the leasing model can save data collection cost up to 53% compared with existing data collection strategies, and illustrate the difference in network performance compared with the game without dishonest owners.","[Yiming Zeng, Pengzhan Zhou, Cong Wang, Ji Liu, Yuanyuan Yang]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),"[U.S., China, USA, U.S., U.S.]",20 December 2022,20,"[Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, U.S., Collage of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Shapingba District, Chongqing, China, Department of Cybersecurity Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, U.S., USA, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, U.S., Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, U.S.]",December,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,Q1,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Collage of Computer Science, Department of Cybersecurity Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ed99
"Smart contracts are automated or self-enforcing contracts that can be used to exchange assets without having to place trust in third parties. Many commercial transactions use smart contracts due to their potential benefits in terms of secure peer-to-peer transactions independent of external parties. Experience shows that many commonly used smart contracts are vulnerable to serious malicious attacks, which may enable attackers to steal valuable assets of involving parties. There is, therefore, a need to apply analysis and automated repair techniques to detect and repair bugs in smart contracts before being deployed. In this work, we present the first general-purpose automated smart contract repair approach that is also gas-aware. Our repair method is search-based and searches among mutations of the buggy contract.

"Ethereum is a blockchain platform that hosts and executes smart contracts. Executing a function of a smart contract burns a certain amount of gas units (a.k.a., gas usage). The total gas usage depends on how much computing power is necessary to carry out the execution of the function. Ethereum follows a free-market policy for deciding the transaction fee for executing a transaction. More specifically, transaction issuers choose how much they are willing to pay for each unit of gas (a.k.a., gas price). The final transaction fee corresponds to the gas price times the gas usage. Miners process transactions to gain mining rewards, which come directly from these transaction fees. The flexibility and the inherent complexity of the gas system pose challenges to the development of blockchain-powered applications. Developers of blockchain-powered applications need to translate requests received in the frontend of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Yet, it is unclear how developers should set the gas parameters of these transactions given that (i) miners are free to prioritize transactions whichever way they wish and (ii) the gas usage of a contract transaction is only known after the transaction is processed and included in a new block. In this article, we analyze the gas usage of Ethereum transactions that were processed between Oct. 2017 and Feb. 2019 (the Byzantium era). We discover that (i) most miners prioritize transactions based on their gas price only, (ii) 25% of the functions that received at least 10 transactions have an unstable gas usage (coefficient of variation = 19%), and (iii) a simple prediction model that operates on the recent gas usage of a function achieves an R-Squared of 0.76 and a median absolute percentage error of 3.3%. We conclude that (i) blockchain-powered application developers should be aware that transaction prioritization in Ethereum is frequently done based solely on the gas price of transactions (e.g., a higher transaction fee does not necessarily imply a higher transaction priority) and act accordingly and (ii) blockchain-powered application developers can leverage gas usage prediction models similar to ours to make more informed decisions to set the gas price of their transactions.

Furthermore, the architectural migration process allows the system to be safely and incrementally transformed. We have evaluated our approach with five real-world software applications.

"The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average.

"Side-channel attacks, which are capable of breaking secrecy via side-channel information, pose a growing threat to the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Masking is an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks by removing the statistical dependence between secrecy and power consumption via randomization. However, designing efficient and effective masked implementations turns out to be an error-prone task. Current techniques for verifying whether masked programs are secure are limited in their applicability and accuracy, especially when they are applied. To bridge this gap, in this article, we first propose a sound type system, equipped with an efficient type inference algorithm, for verifying masked arithmetic programs against higher-order attacks. We then give novel model-counting-based and pattern-matching-based methods that are able to precisely determine whether the potential leaky observable sets detected by the type system are genuine or simply spurious. We evaluate our approach on various implementations of arithmetic cryptographic programs. The experiments confirm that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of applicability, accuracy, and efficiency.","[Pengfei Gao, Hongyi Xie, Fu Song, Taolue Chen]",Software (Q1),"[China, China, China, UK]",11 February 2021,11,"[ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK]",February,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,Q1,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[ShanghaiTech University, ShanghaiTech University, ShanghaiTech University, University of Surrey]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ed9f
"Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended to implement secure decentralised distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared, stored, and verified by participants of the system without needing a central authentication/verification authority. Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems. However, there is a lack of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based systems. This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing configurations prone to potential security risks. To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchain-based systems. We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats. MITRE’s attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems.

"Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as ÐApps. When engineering ÐApps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective ÐApps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., ÐApp developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8m. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan’s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap transaction. EthGasStation’s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, ÐApp developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.","[Michael Pacheco, Gustavo A.

These smart contracts generally had a short life but involved a large amount of money. Whereas identification of these Ponzi schemes before causing financial loss has been significantly important, existing methods suffer from three main deficiencies, i.e., the insufficient dataset, the reliance on the transaction records, and the low accuracy. In this study, we first build a larger dataset. Then, a large number of features from multiple views, including bytecode, semantic, and developers, are extracted. These features are independent of the transaction records. Furthermore, we leveraged machine learning methods to build our identification model, i.e., Multi-view Cascade Ensemble model (MulCas).

"Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain. They are executed for a monetary fee paid in gas—a clear optimization target for smart contract compilers. Because smart contracts are a young, fast-moving field without (manually) fine-tuned compilers, they highly benefit from automated and adaptable approaches, especially as smart contracts are effectively immutable, and as such need a high level of assurance. This makes them an ideal domain for applying formal methods. Super-optimization is a technique to find the best translation of a block of instructions by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. We present a framework for super-optimizing smart contracts based on Max-SMT with two main ingredients: (1) a stack functional specification extracted from the basic blocks of a smart contract, which is simplified using rules capturing the semantics of arithmetic, bit-wise, and relational operations, and (2) the synthesis of optimized blocks, which finds—by means of an efficient SMT encoding—basic blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one.","[Elvira Albert, Pablo Gordillo, Alejandro Hernández-Cerezo, Albert Rubio, Maria A.

"Tokens have become an essential part of blockchain ecosystem, so recognizing token transfer behaviors is crucial for applications depending on blockchain. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot recognize token transfer behaviors accurately and efficiently because of their incomplete patterns and inefficient designs. This work proposes TokenAware, a novel online system for recognizing token transfer behaviors. To improve accuracy, TokenAware infers token transfer behaviors from modifications of internal bookkeeping of a token smart contract for recording the information of token holders (e.g., their addresses and shares). However, recognizing bookkeeping is challenging because smart contract bytecode does not contain type information. TokenAware overcomes the challenge by first learning the instruction sequences for locating basic types and then deriving the instruction sequences for locating sophisticated types that are composed of basic types. To improve efficiency, TokenAware introduces four optimizations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TokenAware with real blockchain data. Results show that TokenAware can automatically identify new types of bookkeeping and recognize 107,202 tokens with 98.7% precision. TokenAware with optimizations merely incurs 4% overhead, which is 1/345 of the overhead led by the counterpart with no optimization.

New privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), increasingly require organizations to explicitly state their data practices in privacy policies. When data practices change, a new version of the policy is released. This can occur a few times a year, when data collection or processing requirements are rapidly changing. Consent evolution raises specific challenges to ensuring GDPR compliance. We propose a formal consent framework to support organizations, data users and data subjects in their understanding of policy evolution under a consent regime that supports both the retroactive and non-retroactive granting and withdrawal of consent. The contributions include: (i) a formal framework to reason about data collection and access under multiple consent granting and revocation scenarios; (ii) a scripting language that implements the consent framework for encoding and executing different scenarios; (iii) five consent evolution use cases that illustrate how organizations would evolve their policies using this framework; and (iv) a scalability evaluation of the reasoning framework. The framework models are used to verify when user consent prevents or detects unauthorized data collection and access. The framework can be integrated into a runtime architecture to monitor policy violations as data practices evolve in real-time. The framework was evaluated using the five use cases and a simulation to measure the framework scalability. The simulation results show that the approach is computationally scalable for use in runtime consent monitoring under a standard model of data collection and access, and practice and policy evolution.","[Marco Robol, Travis D.

"Programming language documentation refers to the set of technical documents that provide application developers with a description of the high-level concepts of a language (e.g., manuals, tutorials, and API references). Such documentation is essential to support application developers in effectively using a programming language. One of the challenges faced by documenters (i.e., personnel that design and produce documentation for a programming language) is to ensure that documentation has relevant information that aligns with the concrete needs of developers, defined as the missing knowledge that developers acquire via voluntary search. In this paper, we present an automated approach to support documenters in evaluating the differences and similarities between the concrete information need of developers and the current state of documentation (a problem that we refer to as the topical alignment of a programming language documentation). Our approach leverages semi-supervised topic modelling that uses domain knowledge to guide the derivation of topics. We initially train a baseline topic model from a set of Rust-related Q&A posts. We then use this baseline model to determine the distribution of topic probabilities of each document of the official Rust documentation. Afterwards, we assess the similarities and differences between the topics of the Q&A posts and the official documentation. Our results show a relatively high level of topical alignment in Rust documentation. Still, information about specific topics is scarce in both the Q&A websites and the documentation, particularly related topics with programming niches such as network, game, and database development. For other topics (e.g., related topics with language features such as structs, patterns and matchings, and foreign function interface), information is only available on Q&A websites while lacking in the official documentation. Finally, we discuss implications for programming language documenters, particularly how to leverage our approach to prioritize topics that should be added to the documentation.","[Filipe R.

"Locating the original region of tampered features is a challenging task for existing 2D vector map fragile watermarking methods. This article presents a 2D vector map fragile watermarking framework that locates not only the current but also the original region of tampered feature groups. In particular, we propose dividing the features of the host vector map into groups, and embedding a watermark consisting of location-bits and check-bits into each group at the sender side. At the receiver side, by comparing the extracted and calculated check-bits, one can identify tampered groups and locate their current regions. Then the location-bits extracted from the mapping groups are used to indicate the original regions of the tampered groups. To demonstrate and analyze the applicability of this framework, we instantiate it by proposing a simulated annealing (SA)-based group division method, a group mapping method, a minimum encasing rectangle (MER) based location-bits generation method and a check-bits generation method, and use an existing reversible data hiding method for watermark embedding. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can locate all the regions influenced by tampering, and the SA-based group division method can get a better region location ability.","[Nana Wang, Mohan Kankanhalli]",Computer Science Applications (Q2); Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics (Q2); Information Systems (Q2); Modeling and Simulation (Q2); Signal Processing (Q2); Geometry and Topology (Q3),"[People's Republic of China, Singapore]",12 September 2018,12,"[Jiangsu Normal University, People's Republic of China, National University of Singapore, Singapore]",September,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,Q2,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Jiangsu Normal University, National University of Singapore]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7edaa
"In the current COVID-19 pandemic, manual contact tracing has been proven to be very helpful to reach close contacts of infected users and slow down spread of the virus. To improve its scalability, a number of automated contact tracing (ACT) solutions have been proposed, and some of them have been deployed. Despite the dedicated efforts, security and privacy issues of these solutions are still open and under intensive debate. In this article, we examine the ACT concept from a broader perspective, by focusing on not only security and privacy issues but also functional issues such as interface, usability, and coverage. We first elaborate on these issues and particularly point out the inevitable privacy leakages in existing Bluetooth Low Energy based ACT solutions, including centralized and decentralized ones. In addition, we examine the existing venue-based ACT solutions and identify their privacy and security concerns. Then, we propose a generic venue-based ACT solution and a concrete instantiation based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Our solution monitors users’ contacting history only in virus-spreading-prone venues and offers higher-level protection for both security and privacy than its predecessors. Finally, we evaluate our solution from security, privacy, and efficiency perspectives, and also highlight how to reduce false positives in some specific indoor environments.",[Qiang Tang],Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q2); Geometry and Topology (Q2); Information Systems (Q2); Modeling and Simulation (Q2); Signal Processing (Q2),[Luxembourg],30 December 2021,30,"[Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST), Esch sur Alzette, Luxembourg]",December,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,Q1,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,[Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST)],ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7edab
"Air pollution is a serious global issue impacting public health and social economy. In particular, exposure to small particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) can cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancer. Fine-grained urban air quality monitoring is crucial yet difficult to achieve. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an ambient environment aware system, namely UbiAir, which can support fine-grained urban air quality monitoring through mobile crowdsensing on a bike-sharing system. We have built specific IoT box configured with multiple pollutant sensors and attached on shared bikes to sample micro-scale air quality data in the monitoring space that is split by a scalable grid structure. Both hardware and software data calibration methods are exploited in UbiAir to make the sampled data reliable. Then, we use Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) as an inference model that leverages the calibrated samples to recover data points without direct measurements and reconstruct an accurate air quality map covering the entire monitoring space. In addition, red envelope based incentive schemes and differential rewarding strategies have been designed in UbiAir, and an adaptive BCS algorithm is proposed to deploy the red envelopes at the most informative positions to facilitate data sampling and inference. We have tested our system on campus with over 100k data measurements collected by 36 students through 18 days. Our real-world experiments show that UbiAir is a light-weight, low-cost, accurate and scalable system for fine-grained air quality monitoring, as compared with other solutions.","[Ada Gavrilovska, Erez Zadok]",Hardware and Architecture (Q3),[],28 May 2021,28,[],May,ACM Transactions on Storage,Q3,ACM Transactions on Storage,INTRODUCTION,[],ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7edac
"Emulating a shared atomic, read/write storage system is a fundamental problem in distributed computing. Replicating atomic objects among a set of data hosts was the norm for traditional implementations (e.g., [11]) in order to guarantee the availability and accessibility of the data despite host failures. As replication is highly storage demanding, recent approaches suggested the use of erasure-codes to offer the same fault-tolerance while optimizing storage usage at the hosts. Initial works focused on a fixed set of data hosts. To guarantee longevity and scalability, a storage service should be able to dynamically mask hosts failures by allowing new hosts to join, and failed host to be removed without service interruptions. This work presents the first erasure-code -based atomic algorithm, called Ares, which allows the set of hosts to be modified in the course of an execution. Ares is composed of three main components: (i) a reconfiguration protocol, (ii) a read/write protocol, and (iii) a set of data access primitives (DAPs). The design of Ares is modular and is such to accommodate the usage of various erasure-code parameters on a per-configuration basis. We provide bounds on the latency of read/write operations and analyze the storage and communication costs of the Ares algorithm.","[Nicolas Nicolaou, Viveck Cadambe, N.

"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in effect since May of 2018. As one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation concerning privacy, it sparked a lot of discussion on the effect it would have on users and providers of online services in particular, due to the large amount of personal data processed in this context. Almost three years later, we are interested in revisiting this question to summarize the impact this new regulation has had on actors in the World Wide Web. Using Scopus, we obtain a vast corpus of academic work to survey studies related to changes on websites since and around the time the GDPR went into force. Our findings show that the emphasis on privacy increased w.r.t. online services, but plenty potential for improvements remains. Although online services are on average more transparent regarding data processing practices in their public data policies, a majority of these policies still either lack information required by the GDPR (e.g., contact information for users to file privacy inquiries) or do not provide this information in a user-friendly form. Additionally, we summarize that online services more often provide means for their users to opt out of data processing, but regularly obstruct convenient access to such means through unnecessarily complex and sometimes illegitimate interface design. Our survey further details that this situation contradicts the preferences expressed by users both verbally and through their actions, and researchers have proposed multiple approaches to facilitate GDPR-conform data processing without negatively impacting the user experience. Thus, we compiled reoccurring points of criticism by privacy researchers and data protection authorities into a list of four guidelines for service providers to consider.","[Michael Kretschmer, Jan Pennekamp, Klaus Wehrle]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q2),"[, Germany, Germany]",14 July 2021,14,"[RWTH Aachen UniversityGermany, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, RWTH Aachen University, Germany]",July,ACM Transactions on the Web,Q2,ACM Transactions on the Web,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[RWTH Aachen UniversityGermany, RWTH Aachen University, RWTH Aachen University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7edae
"We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks and, thereby, DeFi protocols would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.","[Stefan Kitzler, Friedhelm Victor, Pietro Saggese, Bernhard Haslhofer]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q2),"[Austria, Germany, Austria, Austria]",08 October 2022,8,"[Complexity Science Hub Vienna and AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology, Austria, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany, AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology and Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Austria, Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Austria]",October,ACM Transactions on the Web,Q2,ACM Transactions on the Web,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Complexity Science Hub Vienna and AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology, Technische Universität Berlin, AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology and Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Complexity Science Hub Vienna]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edaf

"Blockchain has received tremendous attention as a secure, distributed, and anonymous framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). As a distributed system, blockchain trades off scalability for distribution, which limits the technology’s adaptation for large scale networks such as IoT. All transactions and blocks must be broadcast and verified by all participants which limits scalability and incurs computational and communication overheads. The existing solutions to scale blockchains have so far led to partial recentralization, limiting the technology’s original appeal. In this paper, we introduce a distributed yet scalable Verification and Communication architecture for blockchain referred to as Vericom. Vericom concurrently achieves high scalability and distribution using hash function outputs to shift blockchains from broadcast to multicast communication. Unlike conventional blockchains where all nodes must verify new transactions/blocks, Vericom uses the hash of IoT traffic to randomly select a set of nodes to verify transactions/blocks which in turn reduces the processing overhead. Vericom incorporates two layers: (i) transmission layer where a randomized multicasting method is introduced along with a backbone network to route traffic, i.e., transactions and blocks, from the source to the destination, and (ii) verification layer where a set of randomly selected nodes are allocated to verify each transaction or block. The performance evaluation shows that Vericom reduces the packet and processing overhead as compared with conventional blockchains. In the worst case, packet overhead in Vericom scales linearly with the number of nodes while the processing overhead remains scale-independent.","[JingyaDongabcd, ChunheSongabcd, ShuoLiuabcd, HuanhuanYine, HaoZhengbf, YuanjianLibf]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Software (Q1),[],1 August 2022,1,[],August,Ad Hoc Networks,Q1,Ad Hoc Networks,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edb2

"The blockchain is tremendous technology for securing data transmission over a decentralized cloud environment. A PHR can offer easy data exchange and storage. However, unauthorised individuals may steal sensitive users' data from cloud devices, leading to significant privacy leakage risks. The main problem is that the non-authentication policy leads to key leakages due to unauthorised entries through intruders. To resolve this problem, we propose Blockchain-Based Decentralized Security (BCDS) using Crypto-Proof of Stake (CPoS) for securing sensitive Personal health care records. First, to process the security, the lattice construction phase is used based on blockchain decentralized. The Random shuffle block padding is intended to rehash the block to score with padding bits to block-level encryption. Then the sensitive terms are marginalized by threshold labels being highly encrypted by Optimized Starvation Point Link Encryption (OSPLE) to protect the data. By integrating Master Node Key Aggregation Policy (MNKAP) to verify the contact proof of staking authentication to the peer end to authenticate the security. The Delegate proof of stack provides higher security to protect the sensitive terms by accessing PHR records transactions to improve the integrity proofing to the admittance of the key to deliver the data. The key signature verification then validates the key for authentication to decrypt the protected data. This proves a higher security protocol and authentication principle than any other method as well as security proofing.","[JiajiaJianga, YushuZhanga, YouwenZhua, XuewenDongb, LiangminWangc, YongXiangd]",Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1); Software (Q2),[], November 2022,,[],November,Advances in Engineering Software,Q1,Advances in Engineering Software,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edb4

Blockchain, in particular, is a recent technology that is promising to revolutionize the way supply chains are designed and operated. This paper proposes a framework to optimize the adoption of blockchain jointly with the design of the supply chain network. A new form of product differentiation is enabled through blockchain adoption where blockchain-certified products are sold at a premium price to a growing segment of customers. The proposed framework allows supply chain managers to monetize data which has traditionally been used to improve supply chain efficiency. The framework is evaluated using a realistic case study inspired by the global supply chain of fresh-cut flowers. The results show that by strategically using blockchain at certain locations in the supply chain network, significant cost savings are realized compared to fully deploying blockchain throughout the supply chain. These cost savings lead to increased demand, better consumer surplus, and higher supply chain profit.

"Alliance blockchains provide a multi-party trusted data trading environment, promoting the development of the data trading market in which the value compensation for personal data is still a key issue. However, limited by the data format and content, traditional attempts on data value compensation cannot form a widely applicable solution. Therefore, we propose a universal value compensation method for personal data in alliance blockchains. The basic idea of this method is to evaluate the value weight of data based on the collaborative relationship of data value. First, we construct a Data Collaboration Markov Model (DCMM) to formalize the collaboration network of data value. Then, aiming at data collaboration networks with different structures, the corresponding Segmented PageRank (SPR) algorithm is proposed. SPR can universally evaluate the value weight of each data account without being subjected to the data format or content. Finally, we theoretically deduce that the time complexity and space complexity of SPR algorithm are respectively 1/K and 1/K2 taken by PageRank algorithm. Experiments show the feasibility and superior performance of SPR.","[ChaoxiaQina, BingGuoa, YunZhangb, OmarCheikhrouhouc, YanShend, ZhenZhanga, HongSua]",Computer Science Applications (Q1); Information Systems (Q1); Information Systems and Management (Q1); Management Information Systems (Q1),"[China, China, China, Tunisia, China, China, China]",28 November 2022,28,"[College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China, College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China, College of Finance and Economics, Sichuan International Studies University, Chongqing 400031, China, CES Laboratory, National School of Engineers of Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax 3038, Tunisia, School of Computer Science, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China, College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China, College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China]",November,Big Data Research,Q1,Big Data Research,,"[College of Computer Science, College of Computer Science, College of Finance and Economics, CES Laboratory, School of Computer Science, College of Computer Science, College of Computer Science]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edc2

"Telecom operators are deploying the fifth generation (5G) networks around the world which promises high information transmission rate, wide network coverage, low communication delay, and easy access to a large number of devices. However, during the construction and operation of 5G, telecom operators face many challenges, such as insufficient frequency resources, low efficiency of network management, information opacity, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Blockchain is a distributed system maintained by multiple parties with inherit features including decentralization, traceability and tamperproof. These features collectively contribute to a new application ecosystem where transactions are secure and trustworthy. Therefore, blockchain is expected to integrate with 5G networks to build safer and more reliable mobile network infrastructures. This paper firstly discusses the merits of blockchain technology and the benefits of integrating it with 5G networks. Then a variety of applications of blockchain technology in telecom network operation are reviewed, including spectrum sharing, international roaming settlement, network operation management, number selection management and supply chain management.

"In view of the problem of privacy leakage caused by the centralized location privacy protection method in mobile crowd sensing, a privacy protection method based on blockchain smart contract was proposed. Firstly, the trusted distributed environment blockchain is adopted to replace the third-party server. In order to avoid the leakage of personal information, users register an anonymous identity on the blockchain. In addition, in order to solve the problem of user’s location privacy leakage caused by mutual deceiving behavior among users in distributed structure, a dummy location algorithm based on two-attribute decision is designed on smart contract. In this algorithm, the distance between each location and the user location and the historical query probability of each location are obtained by calculating the peripheral location. Then, different thresholds are set for each location and a cyclic filtering is carried out. As a result, an anonymous set is obtained that effectively protects the user’s location. Finally, the simulation experiment proves that the method can not only improve the efficiency of protecting user’s location privacy, but also has lower time and computation overhead.","[ShuqinLiua, YusongYaob, GuohuaTianb, JianghongWeibc, XialinLiua]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],1 September 2022,1,[],September,Computer Communications,Q1,Computer Communications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edc5
"Crowdsourcing is a potential computing paradigm that exploits collective human intelligence to solve complex tasks, but it suffers from various safety and security problems. Blockchain has emerged as a promising technology to address most of the security issues, however, it is challenging to find an appropriate and trusted blockchain-based consensus protocol for crowdsourcing services. This work proposes a novel Trust-based Blockchain Crowdsourcing consensus protocol that selects a leader and validators based on various trust factors. The proposed protocol addresses a major issue of ensuring correctness associated with the safety and security-critical systems which has a vital importance because failure of such systems may lead to adverse consequences. Mainly it is focused on persistence and liveness properties preventing invalid block insertion and consensus delay attacks. Model checking technique is utilized because of its effectiveness and automatic nature to perform formal verification. The proposed protocol is specified using Communicating Sequential Programs, and the persistence and liveness properties are specified through Linear Temporal Logic. The model verification is performed by giving the formal model and the properties as input to the Process Analysis Toolkit which checks for the satisfaction or violation of the properties.","[JinwenXi, ShihongZou, GuoaiXu, YuemingLu]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],1 August 2022,1,[],August,Computer Communications,Q1,Computer Communications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edc6
"In consideration of the inconvenience of sharing user identity authorization, and the lack of correctness verification for searching electronic medical records in hospitals under the many-to-many search model, we propose an blockchain-aided searchable attribute-based encryption scheme that supports verification, we apply the scheme to electronic health record systems. Using blockchain technology, the ciphertext document is stored in the medical cloud, the secure index is stored in the blockchain, and the smart contract is used for searching, which reduces the computational burden of the medical cloud. In addition, this scheme can verify whether the results returned by the cloud server are correct, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The scheme eliminates duplicate data and reduces the storage space of the medical cloud. Furthermore, users’ privacy security is guaranteed due to the hiding of access policy. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the semantic security of adaptively chosen-keyword attacks, can effectively protect the confidentiality of medical data and anonymity of users. Performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves optimizations in security index generation, trapdoor generation, search efficiency and result verification; hence, it is more suitable for many-to-many search scenarios such as smart medical applications. It effectively realizes the sharing of patient electronic medical records between doctors and third-party users without infringing on patient privacy.","[BotaoZhonga, JiadongGuoa, LuZhanga, HaitaoWub, HengLib, YuhangWanga]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],1 August 2022,1,[],August,Computer Communications,Q1,Computer Communications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edc7

"In vehicle ad-hoc networks, the progression of wireless communication technology to 6G, overcomes storage, processing, privacy, and power limits to create an efficient and intelligent next generation transportation system. Vehicular ad hoc network may now offer remarkable availability, reliability, and throughput using 6G technology. However, the VANET system’s data should be protected. This paper proposes an effective batch authentication and key exchange technique to avoid contact with hostile vehicle users. Moreover, three types of systems are proposed: PKI, ID-based, and MAC-based. The neuro-fuzzy inference technique was used to predict VANET security ratings. The Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain model is used to secure data transit. Additionally, this research examined the work from a blockchain perspective combined with MEC. There are 3 level to comprise the architecture: perception, edge computing, and services. Throughout the blockchain transmission process, the first layer make certain the security of VANET data. The perception layer makes use of edge computing and cloud services on the edge. The service layer protects data by using both traditional cloud storage and blockchain technology. The lowest layer of the system architecture is dedicated to the throughput and quality of service requirements of MEC users. The primary challenge is achieving consensus across blockchain nodes while maintaining the MEC system’s and blockchain’s performance.

"The emergence of a data-driven society has sparked interest in data trading marketplaces. Traditional centralized marketplaces are unable to meet the needs of a transparent, safe, and privacy-protected data marketplace. To address the above challenges, we propose a data marketplace on blockchain with arbitration using side-contracts mechanisms (dMOBAs), in which a consortium of data owners, data buyers, and arbitrators collaborate to create an ecosystem in the blockchain’s witnesses. Our marketplace’s goals are to provide a decentralized platform for trading personal data for both service providers and data owners. In the meantime, the transaction method can be arbitrated. The arbitrators alliance, which is responsible for resolving data disputes, is formed by a service provider jointly nominated by the buyer and seller. The integrity and value of transacted data can be validated thanks to the arbitrators’ consortium. The side-contracts concept decreases the public chain’s overhead and enhances the marketplace’s operating efficiency. The marketplace’s orderly functioning is ensured by explicit incentives and rigorous arbitration methods. To demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the mechanisms, we implement dMOBAs on Ethereum, Fabric and IPFS platforms and analyze its performance. According to the testing results, our arbitration method is 2 times faster than full public chain-based arbitration.","[JoeyLia, Munur SacitHerdembd, JatinNathwanibc, John Z.Wena]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],1 September 2022,1,[],September,Computer Communications,Q1,Computer Communications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edcb
"Secure communication is one of the main challenges that are slowing down the development of the Internet of Things (IoT).

Most of the existing solutions do not consider the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the IoT. They do not regard the difference in capability of its components and impose equal loads on them. Moreover, they store keys in device memories before deployment, which makes adding devices difficult afterwards. We propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based KM protocol for the IoT. Our solution balances the loads between nodes according to their capabilities. We prove that this makes it efficient and scalable. Furthermore, our solution securely rekey the network upon a change.

"It is crucial to ensure the privacy and authenticity of patients’ medical data in the medical insurance claim process, but in the current medical insurance claim process, there are some problems such as low efficiency, complex service, unreliable data and data leakage. Therefore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of patients’ medical data, we can improve the current issues by employing blockchain, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof technology. In this paper, we propose a novel medical insurance claim scheme based on smart contracts, blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme mainly involves two scenarios: medical insurance purchasing and medical insurance claiming. In the privacy-preserving transaction phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and privacy of the transactions between the patients and the insurance companies by using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and the homomorphic encryption algorithm under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In the identity privacy-preserving phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and the privacy of patients’ identities by integrating Schnorr protocol and Fiat–Shamir heuristic method. The security analysis, the computation cost and the communication cost of our scheme are given. Compared with our referred schemes, the performance evaluation shows that our scheme not only meets the requirements of the legality of the medical insurance claim, but also ensures the authenticity and privacy of the patients’ medical data.

"Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to realize distributed machine learning on heterogeneous clients without exposing their private data. However, there is the risk of single point failure with FL because it relies on a central server to gather the model updates from clients, moreover, malicious behaviors of some clients may lead to low-quality or even poisoned global models. Blockchain as a revolutionary distributed ledger technology can alleviate the above problems to significantly enhance the security and scalability of FL systems. Therefore, this article presents a general framework of Blockchain-based Federated Learning (BFL) system with detailed description of its key technologies and operation steps. We then review and compare the most recent representative BFL applications. And we outlook some key challenges and opportunities of the future BFL system in terms of security, cost, and scalability.

"Due to the self-organizing and distributed nature of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), valuable data in sensor networks faces security and privacy risks. A blockchain-based approach enables secure and convenient sharing of sensor information among different users. Compared to public and private blockchains, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases in WSN due to its auditability and high transaction rate. However, sensing data sharing via consortium blockchain raises the privacy issue. Therefore, the data from the sensor node is encrypted by the key (named
) shared by the sensor node and the sink node and then sent to the blockchain network to not reveal the privacy of the sensing data. Since the infrastructure in large-scale WSN is usually owned and managed by multiple organizations, encrypted sensing data needs to be authorized by these multiple organizations for computation. Organizations requesting privacy-preserving data are referred to as data sharers. Distributing the
to each data sharer requires separate encryption of the key using the data sharer’s public key. The sink node needs to be online when each data sharer asks for the
, and one encryption of the
for each data sharer consumes precious resources. This work proposes GSChain for efficient privacy-preserving sensing data sharing on consortium blockchain. Multiple data sharers resort to asymmetric group key agreement protocol to maintain a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys, enabling efficient
retrieval from the consortium blockchain. The
is encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain along with the privacy-preserving sensing data. Our scheme improves the efficiency of privacy-preserving data sharing among multiple data sharers while reducing the online demand for sink nodes. Although the data-sharing group should remain stable for a long time, we design the group key update scheme. We also discuss how old and new data sharers access different ranges of privacy-preserving sensing data as the data-sharing group changes. We build a complete implementation of GSChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and conduct a comprehensive set of experimental studies. Our experimental results demonstrate that GSChain improves the privacy-preserving sensing data sharing efficiency with tolerable time and storage overhead. In addition, the time overhead caused by the recovery of the GSChain system is tolerable when the membership of the data-sharing group changes.","[HuanhuanWangab, XiaoZhanga, YoubingXiaa, XiangWua]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],1 October 2022,1,[],October,Computer Communications,Q1,Computer Communications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edcf

"The future of multi-blockchain architecture depends on the emergence of new protocols that enable consensus between trustless cross-blockchain participants. However, interoperability between blockchains remains a research challenge. The existing interoperability approaches provide integration through solutions using a middleware system, making it difficult to gain confidence in the security and correctness of the process. A cross-blockchain protocol must provide a self-verifiable state proof that encodes trust in the transfer process to guarantee consensus. Inspired by the burn-address concept, we propose a Burn-to-Claim cross-blockchain protocol to exchange assets between two networks. The proposed protocol transfers assets from one blockchain system to another so that the asset is burned from the source blockchain and recreated on the destination blockchain. Our protocol makes use of digital signatures, hash-time-locks and integration mechanisms to perform cross-blockchain transactions in a distributed manner.

"In the past few years, blockchain has proven its necessity and unprecedented prospects in providing a secure environment for information exchange between two parties.

However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system.

"With the rapid popularization and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks, mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) has become an indispensable part in today’s society. However, when task participants submit tasks, they are likely to expose their data privacy and location privacy. These privacy will be maliciously attacked and exploited by attackers (external attackers and untrusted third party). With the rapid increase of MCS data throughput, traditional cloud platforms can no longer meet the huge data processing needs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an MCS federated learning system based on Blockchain and edge computing. This paper uses federated learning as the framework of the MCS system. The system protects data privacy and location privacy by using the Double local disturbance Localized Differential Privacy (DLD-LDP) proposed in this paper. Because the sensed data exists in multiple modalities (text, video, audio, etc.), this paper uses the Multi-modal Transformer (MulT) method to merge the multi-modal data before subsequent operations.

"Modeling highly accurate cyber-attacks on blockchain-based edge networks may be almost impossible in real-world circumstances due to unanticipated adversary (malicious) behavior. In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today’s industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes.","[FangchiQina, YanWua, FangTaob, LuLiuc, LeileiShia, Anthony J.Millerc]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],24 December 2022,24,[],December,Computer Networks,Q1,Computer Networks,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edd6
"Routing on the Internet is defined among autonomous systems (ASes) based on a weak trust model where it is assumed that ASes are honest. While this trust model strengthens the connectivity among ASes, it also results in an attack surface that can be exploited to hijack the routing paths. One such attack is known as the BGP prefix hijacking, in which a malicious AS broadcasts IP prefixes that belong to a target AS, thereby hijacking its traffic. In this paper, we propose RouteChain: a blockchain-based secure BGP routing system that counters BGP hijacking and maintains a consistent view of the Internet routing paths. Towards that, we leverage provenance assurance and tamper-proof properties of blockchains to augment trust among ASes. We group ASes based on their geographical (network) proximity and construct a bi-hierarchical blockchain model that detects false prefixes prior to their spread over the Internet. We evaluate RouteChain using three different consensus protocols and show its effectiveness by drawing a case study with the Youtube hijacking of 2008. Our results show that RouteChain can efficiently detect false prefix announcements and prevent BGP attacks over the Internet.","[PrabhatKumara, RandhirKumarb, Govind P.Guptac, RakeshTripathic, AlirezaJolfaeid, A.K.M.Najmul Islame]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],9 November 2022,9,[],November,Computer Networks,Q1,Computer Networks,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edd7
"In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-and backscatter-aided Internet of Things (IoT) system. In the framework, IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a secondary gateway by using an RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio technology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain network for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the framework enables an IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage and maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the data collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a decentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under dynamics of the primary channel, uncertainty of the IoT devices, and unpredictability of the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i) time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and transmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and (iii) a transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while minimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then propose to employ, evaluate, and assess a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm with Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the gateway. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution outperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional Q-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput and convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the data is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.","[HebinRuana, HongjunGaoa, HaifengQiub, Hoay BengGooib, JunyongLiua]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],4 September 2022,4,[],September,Computer Networks,Q1,Computer Networks,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edd8
"In this paper, we present a high-performance, scalable Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocol TSBFT for the consortium blockchains that does not rely on expensive leader-driven communication. It overcomes the challenges faced by the existing BFT protocol in three aspects: single-point failure, huge total message sizes, and limited by the slowest nodes. The proposed protocol secretly selects block proposers and uses threshold signature as a multi-round voting mechanism to confirm the validity of the proposed block. We adopt transmission pipelining to improve the network utilization while optimizing the gossip communication scheme to reduce the total message sizes. Finally, our protocol guarantees the security and liveness of the system. Experimental results show that, compared with other related BFT protocols (e.g., PBFT), TSBFT can effectively solve these three challenges. In addition, our experiments also show how the different optimization ingredients of TSBFT contribute to its performance and scalability. The results show that compared with the traditional BFT protocol, it can scale from dozens of nodes to hundreds of nodes.","[BaozhuangNiua, HaotaoXua, LeiChenb]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],23 December 2022,23,[],December,Computer Networks,Q1,Computer Networks,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edd9
"Botnet-originated DDoS attacks continue to plague the internet and disrupt services for legitimate users. While various proposals have been presented in the last two decades, the botnet still has advantages over the defenders, because botnets have orchestrated processes to launch disruptive attacks. On the other hand, the defenders use manual methods, siloed tools, and lack orchestration among different organizations. These unorchestrated efforts slow down the attack response and extend the lifespan of botnet attacks. This article presents shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN, an inter-organization collaborative defense framework using P4, SDN, and Blockchain, which extends our earlier research on microVNF, a solution of Edge security for SIP-enabled IoT devices with P4. Besides mitigating DDoS attacks, microVNF also produces attack fingerprints called Indicator of Compromise (IOC) records. ShieldSDN and shieldCHAIN distribute these IOCs to other organizations so that they can create their own packet filters. Effectively, shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN synchronize packet filters for different organizations to mitigate against the same botnet strain. Four experiments were performed successfully to validate the functionalities of shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN. The scope for the first experiment was intra-company, while the second, third, and fourth experiments were inter-company. In the first experiment, shieldSDN extracted IOCs from the source switch and installed these as packet filters on other switches within the same organization (in the U.S.). In the second experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the publishing organization (in the U.S.) shared IOCs by posting them to the Blockchain. In the third experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations (in Singapore & the U.K.) retrieved these IOCs from Blockchain. Finally, in the last experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations installed the retrieved IOCs as packet filters; that are identical to those in the originating organization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that uses the P4 switch, SDN controller, and Blockchain together for this use case. As SDN and Blockchain gain acceptance, this framework empowers community members to collaborate and defend against botnet DDoS attacks.","[HuanhuanWangab, XiaoZhanga, YoubingXiaa, XiangWua]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1),[],24 October 2022,24,[],October,Computer Networks,Q1,Computer Networks,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edda
"Smart contracts allow application developers to automate business processes through a decentralized computation architecture.

We adopt Hyperledger Besu and Tendermint in this research, given that both are BFT-based blockchains. Also, it is noteworthy that smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms such as Tendermint are not well established and not widely adopted yet.

The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious challenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03% and increase the performance up to 73.11%, thus decreasing the cost of drone-ledger preservation down to 30.13% and the robust usage of the network up to 54.29% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods .",[OlivierJutel1],Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Control and Systems Engineering (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1),[], September 2022,,[],September,Computers and Electrical Engineering,Q1,Computers and Electrical Engineering,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ede5

"The increased density of the urban population and frequent transportation movement has lead to parking issues in these areas. Many efforts have been made to efficiently utilize the existing parking facilities. Most of these solutions target the large-scale private and public parking facilities; however, the individual parking facilities are not much explored and exploited for reducing the parking issues. In the last few years, the Online-to-Offline (O2O) model has witnessed huge attention from the research community due to its versatile applications in many domains. The main objective of the O2O model is to create service awareness online, allowing potential users to review different offers and then visit local physical places for purchasing. The security of the users’ data has always been considered a crucial factor in any public sharing platform. The blockchain model has been regarded as a solid security platform for many public sharing platforms. This work designed a blockchain framework with a novel data verification and role-based Access control method for securing the parking service data. Several experiments are performed using the sawtooth blockchain tool to investigate the performance of the proposed blockchain framework against the baseline approach concerning latency, meantime testing (MTT), throughput, transaction sending rate (TPS), and average response time (ART). The obtained results confirm that the proposed approach is scalable and feasible for smart parking and other IoT-based applications.","[QingyunZhua, ChunguangBaib, JosephSarkiscde]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Control and Systems Engineering (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1),[], October 2022,,[],October,Computers and Electrical Engineering,Q1,Computers and Electrical Engineering,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ede9
"Blockchain as the trust‐enabling technology has supported and transformed cyber-physical systems in recent years. Therefore, many organizations have adopted blockchain-based technology to develop industrial software-product-service systems. However, the implementation of blockchain at the organizational levels can be related with several technical, organizational, legal, financial, and environmental challenges (intra-organizational and inter-organizational). Analysis of these challenges will play a significant role in organizational performance. This study has investigated an extensive list of challenges of software blockchain-based implementation in cyber-physical systems. The proposed comprehensive model is applied to the software development industry in Iran as a case study. Based on the experts’ opinions, challenge identification was conducted via the two-phase fuzzy Delphi method for medium and large organizations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative challenges are evaluated via the efficient best-worst fuzzy method. Obtained results indicate that smart contracts vulnerabilities and deterministic execution of the technical challenge group have the most critical importance and governance of the legal challenge group has the least vital importance.

"Due to the drastic increase in the number of vehicles, searching for available parking spots has become a major problem for drivers, especially in crowded and big cities. Thus, a smart parking system is crucial not only to facilitate drivers’ ability to find parking spaces, but also to reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and vehicles’ gas consumption. A growing number of public parking lots have been constructed to provide parking spots for drivers. Meanwhile, homeowners and landowners leave their private spaces that can be utilized and rented for other drivers seeking parking spaces. This paper proposes a decentralized smart private-parking scheme built on top of Blockchain. Blockchain is used to run and organize the developed parking scheme to help drivers find nearby parking spots owned by private homeowners and landowners. However, parking owners and drivers should send requests/offers that include the location/time information of spots and/or desired locations to park at. This information can be used to track daily live activities for both drivers and parking owners such as whether a parking owner is at home or not, drivers’ destinations, etc. To preserve privacy, in the proposed scheme, drivers/parking owners submit their requests/offers in an encrypted format, and the Blockchain can find feasible matches among the encrypted requests and offers without the need to get access to original sensitive information. In addition, an overlapping and partitioning technique is used to generate the requests/offers to increase matching results by finding more nearby drivers to park and thus maximizing parking owners’ profits. Finally, the proposed scheme has been implemented on Hyperledger Blockchain and extensive evaluations have been conducted using different simulation scenarios. The results indicate that the scheme is efficient in terms of scalability and throughput under different case scenarios. Also, security and privacy analysis are conducted to demonstrate that the scheme can run the services securely while ensuring drivers/parking owners’ privacy.","[ShoufengCaoa, MarcusFotha, WarwickPowellab, ThomasMillera, MingLicd]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Control and Systems Engineering (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1),[], October 2022,,[],October,Computers and Electrical Engineering,Q1,Computers and Electrical Engineering,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edeb
"A cheating-free (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme using Blockchain is presented, where Shamir's technique is followed and the Blockchain vulnerabilities due to PoW/PoS (Proof-of-Work/Stake) consensus, are removed. We address the shares’ cheating issues and design a Blockchain based SS scheme, in which the participants’ shares are recorded secretly in a block and the dealer's identity along with other parameters are made visible through the genesis block. Our scheme uses a short-length Blockchain comprising 2 blocks per secret negotiation session. The main objectives are to improve Shamir's secret sharing scheme with Blockchain such that the cheating activities from dealer and/or participants become infeasible, and to enhance Blockchain technology with a consensus mechanism using Blockchain based SS scheme such that insecurity of PoW/PoS consensus are avoidable. The security and performance analysis of the scheme are provided.

"Heart disease is one of the leading causes for death in men and women across the globe. Several characteristics that can be monitored to predict the heart disease in the earlier stage are blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar level and body weight. The technology is revolutionizing the existing healthcare infrastructure. With the inclusion of Internet of Things (IoT), now we can monitor patients remotely, store their data, and process it for further analysis. However, the need is to propose new and advanced secured algorithms for fast processing and efficient detection of events. In this article, a machine learning based Sine Cosine Weighted K-Nearest Neighbour (SCA_WKNN) algorithm is proposed for the heart disease prediction that learns from the data being stored in blockchain. Since the data stored in the blockchain are tamper resistant, it acts as an authentic source for learning data and also as a secure storage environment for patient information. The performance of proposed SCA_WKNN is assessed in comparison with other algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and root mean square error. Our analysis indicates that SCA_WKNN achieves 4.59% and 15.61% maximum accuracy than W K-NN and K-NN, respectively. Also, blockchain-based storage is compared with peer-to-peer storage in terms of latency and throughput. The blockchain-based decentralized storage achieves 25.03% maximum throughput than peer-to-peer storage.","[LodovicaMarchesi, MicheleMarchesi, RobertoTonelli, Maria IlariaLunesu]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Control and Systems Engineering (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1),[], July 2022,,[],July,Computers and Electrical Engineering,Q1,Computers and Electrical Engineering,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eded

"With the rapid advancement of cloud computing, cloud storage services have developed rapidly. One issue that has attracted particular attention in such remote storage services is that cloud storage servers are not enough to reliably save and maintain data, which greatly affects users’ confidence in purchasing and consuming cloud storage services. Traditional data integrity auditing techniques for cloud data storage are centralized, which faces huge security risks due to single-point-of-failure and vulnerabilities of central auditing servers. Blockchain technology offers a new approach to this problem. Many researchers have endeavored to employ the blockchain for data integrity auditing. Based on the search of relevant papers, we found that existing literature lacks a thorough survey of blockchain-based integrity auditing for cloud data. In this paper, we make an in-depth survey on cloud data integrity auditing based on blockchain. Firstly, we cover essential basic knowledge of integrity auditing for cloud data and blockchain techniques. Then, we propose a series of requirements for evaluating existing Blockchain-based Data Integrity Auditing (BDIA) schemes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of existing BDIA schemes and evaluate them based on our proposed criteria. Finally, according to our completed review and analysis, we explore some open issues and suggest research directions worthy of further efforts in the future.","[HaoxiangHana, ShufanFeia, ZhengYana, XiaokangZhoubc]",Communication (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1),[], October 2022,,[],October,Digital Communications and Networks,Q1,Digital Communications and Networks,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edf3
"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain. All historical Bitcoin transactions are stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, but Bitcoin owners are generally unknown. This is the reason for Bitcoin's pseudo-anonymity, therefore it is often used for illegal transactions. Bitcoin addresses are related to Bitcoin users' identities. Some Bitcoin addresses have the potential to be analyzed due to the behavior patterns of Bitcoin transactions. However, existing Bitcoin analysis methods do not consider the fusion of new blocks' data, resulting in low efficiency of Bitcoin address analysis. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes an incremental Bitcoin address cluster method to avoid re-clustering when new block data is added. Besides, a heuristic Bitcoin address clustering algorithm is developed to improve clustering accuracy for the Bitcoin Blockchain. Experimental results show that the proposed method increases Bitcoin address cluster efficiency and accuracy.","[FangchiQina, YanWua, FangTaob, LuLiuc, LeileiShia, Anthony J.Millerc]",Communication (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1),"[China, China, UK, UK, China, UK]", October 2022,,"[Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Security Technology for Industrial Cyberspace, School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, China, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Security Technology for Industrial Cyberspace, School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, China, Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham, UK, School of Informatics, University of Leicester, UK, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Security Technology for Industrial Cyberspace, School of Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering, Jiangsu University, China, School of Informatics, University of Leicester, UK]",October,Digital Communications and Networks,Q1,Digital Communications and Networks,,"[Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Security Technology for Industrial Cyberspace, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Security Technology for Industrial Cyberspace, Birmingham Business School, School of Informatics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Security Technology for Industrial Cyberspace, School of Informatics]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edf4
"Electronic Health monitoring system has performed an essential role in managing healthcare monitoring. E-health can provide effective and valuable facilities for the patients to monitor.

"Internet of Things (IoT) networks are large peer-to-peer networks of small devices that require a competent security system that is scalable and adaptable to the limited resources of the IoT devices. Node authentication is a crucial part of IoT security. The current authentication solutions require a centralized trusted party for authentication, which presents a single point of failure. Blockchain as a peer-to-peer network with decentralized authentication can provide a decentralized solution for node authentication. In existing literature, most blockchain applications in IoT are connected to existing blockchain networks by more computationally capable devices, thereby limiting their adaptability for IoT networks and presenting single point of failure problem. Considering the issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized structure for authentication by arranging the IoT devices into clusters based on their computational capability, energy reserve and their location. The devices in each cluster are authenticated by a hierarchical structure of interconnected blockchains. To reduce the processing load we introduced a consensus protocol based on verifying identity-based encryption key signature of the device and its related cluster. The proposed structure simulation has shown a reduction of the processor and memory load of IoT devices. Further testing using Docker container network and Raspberry Pi devices network has shown that the proposed blockchain structure and consensus algorithm have reduced computational load. The analysis of the structure security and performance shows it offers comprehensive security protection while being lightweight and scalable.","[Mahmoud TayseerAl Ahmedab, FazirulhisyamHashima, ShaifulJahari Hashima, AzizolAbdullahc]",Computer Science Applications (Q1); Information Systems (Q1); Management Science and Operations Research (Q1),[], July 2022,,[],July,Egyptian Informatics Journal,Q1,Egyptian Informatics Journal,Full length article,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edf6
"Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces.

"Distributed energy resources not only change the energy supply modes but also have great potential in energy transformation.

"With the continuous convenience of life, logistics has become an indispensable existence in life. Logistics application, such as the southern banana transportation to the country, major cities can buy all the year round; Xinjiang ha honey melon, Ningxia white orchid melon, northeast rice, Tianjin small station rice are not seasonal supply market. However, with the increasing frequency of logistics activities, its damage to natural resources and ecological environment is becoming more and more serious. The waste produced in logistics is increasing day by day, which puts great pressure on the environment. Such as steel slag, industrial waste water, waste computers, waste batteries and other kinds of inorganic waste. Goods return is the most important activity in the green reverse logistics. Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a “double chain” structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics.",[JinshunWu],Energy (miscellaneous) (Q1),[China], November 2022,,"[School of Economics and Management, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, China]",November,Energy Reports,Q1,Energy Reports,,[School of Economics and Management],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7edfd
"The construction of smart grid has triggered comprehensive changes in power equipment. At the same time, massive data are waiting to be screened, analyzed and processed. However, there are many data sources and complex data structure in smart grid, and smart grid requires higher security, reliability, traceability, non-repudiation and real-time performance of data processing, which poses unprecedented challenges to the traditional data management. Blockchain technology has the advantages of decentralization, autonomy, leakage prevention and openness.

"With the development of new energy, the ancillary service demand of power grid is increasing. The published literature focuses on building a blockchain ancillary service market to ensure the safety and efficiency of ancillary service transactions. However, due to the high threshold and poor scalability, the existing blockchain market is hard to meet the demand of the response rate of ancillary services. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy storage capacity competition-based demand response method in blockchain ancillary service market. Firstly, a new market structure is proposed, which uses the Proof of Capacity (POC) as the consensus mechanism. The structure uses POC to realize the competition among users’ energy storage capacity. Secondly, the demand response process of ancillary service market is designed. During the transaction processes, the probability of users participating in the transaction is changed according to the users’ storage capacity. Dealing with different demands, the market chooses the user with the largest capacity or the combination of users to respond. The simulation shows that, compared with the traditional ancillary service market, the capacity competition-based market demand response rate is increased by 20%, the time to fulling all users’ capacity in the market is reduced by 2 h, and the call rate of user’s capacity is increased by 10%.","[MuyiLiu, HaixinWang, DeyunHan, JunyouYang, YanzhenLi]",Energy (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China]", November 2022,,"[Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China]",November,Energy Reports,Q1,Energy Reports,"2022 International Conference on the Energy Internet and Energy Interactive Technology (EIEIT 2022), March 25–27, 2022, Wuhan, China","[Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang University of Technology]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee05

Firstly, a two-stage transaction mechanism for demand response quota considering day-ahead bidding transaction and intra-day double auction transaction is designed. Then, the smart contract is introduced to realize the proposed blockchain-based two-stage transaction mechanism of demand response quota, and all the smart contract functions involved in each business link are customized.

"With the continuous convenience of life, logistics has become an indispensable existence in life. Logistics application, such as the southern banana transportation to the country, major cities can buy all the year round; Xinjiang ha honey melon, Ningxia white orchid melon, northeast rice, Tianjin small station rice are not seasonal supply market. However, with the increasing frequency of logistics activities, its damage to natural resources and ecological environment is becoming more and more serious. The waste produced in logistics is increasing day by day, which puts great pressure on the environment. Such as steel slag, industrial waste water, waste computers, waste batteries and other kinds of inorganic waste. Goods return is the most important activity in the green reverse logistics. Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a “double chain” structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics.",[JinshunWu],Energy (miscellaneous) (Q1),[China], November 2022,,"[School of Economics and Management, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, China]",November,Energy Reports,Q1,Energy Reports,,[School of Economics and Management],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee07

"Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies introduced in Bitcoin, which engaged great attention from the industry and academia and determined a rapid growth of other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). In the complex architecture of a DLT system, a consensus protocol plays a key role by ensuring that all participants agree on the data integrity without any central authority. A wide range of consensus protocols have been designed with different concepts and properties (e.g., lower energy consumption, better scalability, smaller latency, higher throughput, etc.). The key requirements for consensus protocols passing from one blockchain system to another often differ significantly, and there is no one-fit-all protocol. Therefore, selecting the most suitable consensus protocol for a particular DLT system is essential, but at the same time a challenging step, as decision-makers need to make a trade-off between conflicting requirements. This paper introduces a framework for selecting the most suitable consensus protocols depending on the identified criteria, priorities, and other requirements by incorporating Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. We demonstrate its potential by identifying the preferable consensuses for the three most common types of existing blockchain systems and on an actual application for bike renting.

"Industry 4.0 has the potential to create new industrial revolution by offering intelligent, secure, independent, and self-adaptive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. These IIoT nodes can be grouped via the clustering process into clusters to enhance networks’ efficiency, lifetime, and scalability. However, it offers several benefits but still security is a primary concern, which can be resolved by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and blockchain technology. Therefore, an effective Blockchain-Assisted Cluster-based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT, called the BAC-IDS technique has been devised. The proposed BAC-IDS model aims to cluster the IIoT devices for detecting the intrusions and enabling blockchain-based secure data transmission. BAC-IDS technique involves Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)-based clustering technique to choose the Cluster Heads (CH) effectively and construct clusters accordingly. In addition, Chicken Swarm Optimization with Gated Recurrent Unit-based intrusion detection is also followed to determine the presence of intrusions in IIoT environment. Moreover, blockchain technology enables secure data transmission from Cluster Members (CMs) to CHs. The design of HHO clustering and CSO-based hyperparameter optimization for the IIoT environment represents the novelty of the proposed work. A wide range of simulations are performed under different aspects. From experimental results, it has been observed that the BAC-IDS approach has gained a TNR (99.97%), AUC (99.96%), precision (99.99%), recall (99.97%), accuracy (99.98%), F-score (99.98%) and error rate (0.03) on NSL-KDD2015 dataset.

This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process.

"The use of blockchain technology leads to improved operations and supply chain (SC) integration. Moreover, identifying and evaluating the blockchain technology application criteria in the logistics system is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) challenge that requires taking into account the perspectives of experts with varying degrees of SC expertise. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel group decision-making method based on the best-worst method (BWM) to evaluate the criteria of implementing blockchain technology in the SC. The proposed approach provides a mechanism whereby opinions of decision-makers (DMs) are aggregated in nine steps, first. Then, weights of criteria are determined using BWM individual decision-making models. Moreover, two individual decision-making methods called nonlinear goal programming based BWM II (NGPBWM II) and linear goal programming based BWM II (LGPBWM II) are extended in this study, which can be adopted in both individual and group decision-making problems. The NGPBWM II and LGPBWM II methods can be used for both individual and group decision-making. This study proposes a novel group decision-making framework. The framework has fewer constraints than previous group BWM models and can consider different best (worst) criteria by different DMs. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated employing eight numerical examples. The results reveal the high accuracy of the NGPBWM II in all eight examples. Therefore, a combination of the proposed group decision-making method and NGPBWM II is applied in a real case to evaluate the application criteria of the blockchain technology in the automotive industry SC, which was a new application for using blockchain technology in SC.","[SarahQahtanac, KhaironiYatima, HazuraZulzalila, Mohd HafeezOsmana, A.A.Zaidanb, H.A.Alsattard]",Artificial Intelligence (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Engineering (miscellaneous) (Q1),[],15 July 2022,15,[],July,Expert Systems with Applications,Q1,Expert Systems with Applications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee0f

"Architectural design patterns (ADPs) are architectural solutions to common architectural design problems. They are an important concept in software architectures used for the design and analysis of architectures. An ADP usually constrains the design of an architecture and, in turn, guarantees some desired properties for architectures implementing it. Sometimes, however, the constraints imposed by an ADP do not lead to the claimed guarantee. Thus, applying such patterns for the design of architectures might result in architectures which do not fulfill their intended requirements. To address this problem, we propose an approach for the verification of ADPs, based on interactive theorem proving. To this end, we introduce a model for dynamic architectures and a language for the specification of ADPs over this model. Moreover, we propose a framework for the interactive verification of such specifications based on Isabelle/HOL.

"The hardware description language Verilog has been standardized and widely used in industry. Multithreaded Discrete Event Simulation Language (MDESL) is a Verilog-like language and it contains a rich variety of interesting features such as the event-driven computation and shared-variable concurrency as well as the realtime feature. In this paper, we present the denotational semantics for MDESL based on UTP. First a discrete time semantic model is proposed to describe the observation-oriented semantics for MDESL. The observations record the change of variables of atomic actions over time. Then the healthy formulae are defined to denote all different behaviors of programs and the semantics of programs is expressed in terms of healthy formulae. In addition, we demonstrate some interesting properties about the MDESL programs expressing as algebraic laws and their proofs are supported by our formalized denotational semantics. Our theoretical approach is complemented by a practical one, we use the theorem proof assistant Coq to formalize the UTP-based semantics for MDESL. The correctness of the algebraic laws is also verified via the mechanical approach in Coq. Our work provides a novel way to verify the correctness of UTP-based semantics forMDESL both in a theoretical approach and in a practical approach. It is also a new attempt for the application of Coq in the mechanized semantics.","[Feng Sheng, Huibiao Zhu, Jifeng He, Zongyuan Yang, Jonathan P.

"In today’s world, critical infrastructure is often controlled by computing systems. This introduces new risks for cyber attacks, which can compromise the security and disrupt the functionality of these systems. It is therefore necessary to build such systems with strong guarantees of resiliency against cyber attacks. One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal verification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber security properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber security and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM into the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking, and lightweight FM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of terms. We further develop categories based on the type of computing system FM are applied in. Solutions in each class and category are presented, discussed, compared, and summarised. We describe historical highlights and developments and present a state-of-the-art review in the area of FM in cyber security. This review is presented from the point of view of FM practitioners and researchers, commenting on the trends in each of the classes and categories. This is achieved by considering all types of FM, several types of security and safety-critical systems, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article hence provides a comprehensive overview of FM and techniques available to system designers of security-critical systems, simplifying the process of choosing the right tool for the task. The article concludes by summarising the discussion of the review, focusing on best practices, challenges, general future trends, and directions of research within this field.","[Tomas Kulik, Brijesh Dongol, Peter Gorm Larsen, Hugo Daniel Macedo, Steve Schneider, Peter W.

"The Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge allows cloud computing services for topology and location-sensitive distributed computing. As an immediate benefit, it improves network reliability and latency by enabling data access and processing rapidly and efficiently near IoT devices. However, it comes with several issues stemming from the complexity, the security, the energy consumption, and the instability due to the decentralization of service localization. Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward. Blockchain has been envisioned to enforce trustworthiness in diverse IoT environments. However, high latency and high energy costs are incurred to process IoT transactions. This paper introduces a novel Blockchain-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to enable energy-aware task scheduling and offloading in an Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT network. The Asynchronous Actor–Critic Agent (A3C) DRL-based policy achieves efficient task scheduling and offloading. The latter is in symbiosis with Proof-of-Authority Blockchain consensus to validate IoT transactions and blocks. By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically. Carried out experiments put forth that our approach offers 50% better energy efficiency, which outperforms traditional consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work and PBFT, in terms of throughput and network latency and offers better scheduling performance.","[JinwenXi, ShihongZou, GuoaiXu, YuemingLu]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Software (Q1),[], December 2022,,[],December,Future Generation Computer Systems,Q1,Future Generation Computer Systems,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee16
"Every organization relies on a designed contract to manage the rules that guide and coordinate the activities within each organization. However, traditional and contracts have many challenges. This has created the need for automated digital contracts, which are largely used within organizations. Although these contracts provide their own sets of advantages, they still have a single point of failure and still rely on trusted parties that cannot enforce rules. This has caused the introduction of blockchain smart contracts to help organizations collaborate in a decentralized manner. However, most contracting approaches are still influenced by traditional contracting schemes and cannot leverage the blockchain’s features. This has made contracts designed over the blockchain network inefficient and difficult to manage. Existing contractual approaches also do not account for the full advantages of blockchain smart contracts due to a lack of focus in this area. The blockchain and its contracting mechanism are unique, and thus, a unique perspective must be brought in designing a contracting scheme that works efficiently with the blockchain and its inherent smart contracts. In this work, we develop a unique contractual approach that is adaptive to the blockchain and leverages its features in ensuring an efficient contracting scheme that is able to solve the major operations within organizations. We introduce a novel concept of contracting among blockchain networks using existing contract theory concepts to understand better how participants can work together across multiple organizations. We create a novel multi-contracting scheme for multiple parties to collaborate and work together efficiently between multiple organizations, ensuring the completion of projects and contract solidification. We develop a complex interlinked system of contracts to make contacts among multiple organizations easily traceable and manageable. We enhance this with a unique contract consolidation scheme to avoid redundancy. We utilize our proposed scheme to develop a uniquely transparent and fair workflow within organizations such as recruitment and employment leveraging blockchain-based oracle nodes. We extend this work to outsourced and sub-outsourced projects on the blockchain where an arbitration scheme is developed in multi-arbitration and multi-contracting scenarios. We also consider in our case in ex-facto situations. We tested our proposed blockchain-based idea over existing blockchain networks.

"Genomic data repositories are rapidly growing due to the decline in the cost of DNA sequencing. This has increased the demand from stakeholders such as researchers to analyze these datasets to advance areas in biomedical research. Genomic datasets are mostly maintained by third-party direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic companies who operate a business model of collecting DNA data from their customers and selling them to pharmaceutical companies. This puts the privacy of their customers at risk since each individual’s human genome is unique. In addition, customers lose ownership of and access to their genomic data to DTCs and DTCs do not share profits from data sales with them. In this paper, we propose a system based on blockchain technology and homomorphic computation to address the aforementioned problems. We use blockchain transactions and smart contracts to allow genomic data owners (DOs) to have control of their data and sell access to it, and homomorphic computation with secure two-party protocol to enable genomic data users (DUs) to run queries to securely discover DOs of interest. We further optimize the query response time by proposing an approach based on genomic data partitions, binary search trees and bloom filters to reduce the search space. We also propose a blockchain penalty mechanism to encourage parties to behave honestly to avoid malicious behaviors such as uploading fake or non-human genomic data. We conduct our experiments on real genomic datasets and demonstrate that our proposed scheme allows DOs to control access to their data and is feasible and efficient in terms of computation cost, query response time and scalability.","[ShuningYao*, YuanyiLiu*, XiutianShi*]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Software (Q1),[], December 2022,,[],December,Future Generation Computer Systems,Q1,Future Generation Computer Systems,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee18

"In order to have transactions executed and recorded on blockchains such as the Ethereum Mainnet, fees expressed in crypto-currency units of the blockchain must be paid. One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum blockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test networks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as Bloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets. Since transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions are consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small amounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some small amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result, rather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more general distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary amounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this end, Max–min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralised settings. Our work contributes a Max–min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart contract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the number of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart contract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users would mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making the smart contract ineffective. We report tests which confirm that the low transaction cost aims have been achieved by our algorithm.","[YingWua, YanpengWua, HalilCimenb, Juan C.Vasqueza, Josep M.Guerreroa]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Software (Q1),[], June 2022,,[],June,Future Generation Computer Systems,Q1,Future Generation Computer Systems,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee1b
"Recording vehicle driving data into the blockchain can effectively solve problems of data authenticity and security, which is a focus of research on blockchain and the Internet of Vehicles. However, when using blockchain technology, the proof-of-work completed by vehicles may consume substantial energy and computing resources, which limits the application of blockchain technology in the internet of vehicles environment. Therefore, this paper considers deploying edge computing nodes to support blockchain technology and introducing an auction mechanism to encourage users to record vehicle driving data as miners. This paper proposes two auction mechanisms for the blockchain network formed by edge computing service providers and miners to maximize the social welfare. Specifically, one mechanism is used when the resource demands of the miners are the same, and the other is used when the resource demands of the miners are different. For resource allocation, the former uses the maximum cost maximum flow algorithm to achieve optimal allocation, and the latter uses a heuristic algorithm. For price payment, the former uses the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism, and the latter uses dichotomy. These two price payment algorithms use critical value theory to calculate the payment price. This paper demonstrates that both are truthful and individually rational. Through experiments, this paper evaluates indicators such as social welfare, satisfaction, and resource utilization. The experiments show that the proposed auction mechanism can effectively maximize social welfare in the blockchain network and provide an effective resource allocation strategy for edge computing service providers.","[BaozhuangNiua, JianDonga, ZhipengDaia, Jimmy YongJinb]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Software (Q1),[], July 2022,,[],July,Future Generation Computer Systems,Q1,Future Generation Computer Systems,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee1c

"Financial institutions are following an open banking (OB) trend for service innovation and integration. OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.","[MalkarVinod Ramchandraa, KrishanKumarb, AbhijitSarkarc, SamratKr.

"In this paper, we address the problem of behavior prediction for task allocation in blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. Centralized crowdsourcing frameworks complement workers’ reputations with predicted behavior, through Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve the task allocation performance and maintain worker engagement. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks allocate tasks to workers using reputation solely, which neglects the impact of a task’s context on the worker’s behavior. Our contribution is an on-chain behavior prediction ML model for task allocation on top of a proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. The ML model, hosted on blockchain, reflects a worker’s unique behavior for a task given its context. The proposed ML model is: (1) trained off-chain since it has lower monetary cost compared to on-chain training, and (2) deployed on-chain as a smart contract to enable transparent predictions. The task allocation mechanism in the proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework considers workers’ predicted behavior and a Quality of Information (QoI) metric that includes distance to the task, completion time, and workers’ reputation. The evaluation conducted confirms that the proposed task allocation mechanism, implemented using Solidity, outperforms the benchmark in terms of percentage of allocation, workers’ QoI, and reputation change.","[HuanhuanWangab, XiaoZhanga, YoubingXiaa, XiangWua]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Software (Q1),[], November 2022,,[],November,Future Generation Computer Systems,Q1,Future Generation Computer Systems,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee21

"As the complexity of emergencies continues to increase, responding to them often exceeds the capabilities of any single public agency, multi-agent collaborative participation is an inevitable tendency in the development of emergency management. In the collaborative emergency response, it is important to support various responders with a unified platform to assist in decision-making, distribution of resources, and coordination of emergency operation. In recent years, blockchain has provided strong support for the innovation of emergency management mechanisms with its technical advantages such as distributed storage, decentralization, consensus algorithms, tamper-proof, traceability, and smart contract.

"Diverse technologies, such as machine learning and big data, have been driving the prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous proliferation of IoT devices. Consequently, it is natural that IoT becomes the driving force to meet the increasing demand for frictionless transactions. To secure transactions in IoT, blockchain is widely deployed since it can remove the necessity of a trusted central authority. However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and financial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target Denial of Service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new committee members auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamir’s secret-sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLB’s resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamoto’s attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms.

"The blockchain-enabled internet of medical things (IoMT) is an emerging paradigm that could provide strong trust establishment and ensure the traceability of data sharing in the IoMT networks. One of the fundamental building blocks for Blockchain is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nevertheless, when processing a large number of transactions, the verification of multiple signatures will incur cumbersome overhead to the nodes in Blockchain. Although batch verification is able to provide a promising approach that verifies multiple signatures simultaneously and efficiently, the upper bound of batch size is limited to small-scale and the efficiency will drop rapidly as the batch size grows in the state-of-the-art ECDSA batch schemes. Meanwhile, most of the existing researches only focus on improving the efficiency of batch verification algorithms in various cryptosystem while ignoring the identification of invalid signatures, which could cause severe performance degradation when the batch verification fails. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an efficient and large-scale batch verification scheme with group testing technology based on ECDSA. The application of the presented protocols in Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric has been analyzed as supportive and effective. When the batch verification returns a false result, we utilize group testing technology to improve the efficiency of identifying invalid signatures. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol outperforms the related ECDSA batch verification schemes.",Kuo-Hui Yeh;Hu Xiong;Chuanjie Jin;Hanxiao Wang;Mamoun Alazab;Thippa Reddy Gadekallu;Weizheng Wang;Chunhua Su,Biotechnology (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Health Information Management (Q1), Hong Kong; China; India; Taiwan; Australia; Japan,  2022,,"[School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, College of Engineering, IT, and Environment, Charles Darwin University, Casuarina, NT, Australia, Department of Information Management, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan, School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, School of Information Technology and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India, Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Division of Computer Science, University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan]",,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Q1,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics," Volume: 26, Issue: 5", National Dong Hwa University; University of Aizu;College of Engineering;School of Information Technology and Engineering;School of Information and Software Engineering; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China; Vellore Institute of Technology;Department of Information Management; IT; City University of Hong Kong;Department of Computer Science;Division of Computer Science,,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee29
"Blockchain performance cannot meet the requirement nowadays. One of the crucial ways to improve performance is sharding. However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on the public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, multiple-shard contract calling, strict transaction atomicity, and shard availability, which are essential requirements but also challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving flexible multiple-shard contract calling. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. On a test-bed of 128 AliCloud servers, setting 32 shards and 4 consortium members, Meepo-OpenEtheruem can achieve more than 140,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions.

"The evolution of the Internet of Things has seen data sharing as one of its most useful applications in cloud computing. As eye-catching as this technology has been, data security remains one of the obstacles it faces since the wrongful use of data leads to several damages. In this article, we propose a proxy re-encryption approach to secure data sharing in cloud environments. Data owners can outsource their encrypted data to the cloud using identity-based encryption, while proxy re-encryption construction will grant legitimate users access to the data. With the Internet of Things devices being resource-constrained, an edge device acts as a proxy server to handle intensive computations. Also, we make use of the features of information-centric networking to deliver cached content in the proxy effectively, thus improving the quality of service and making good use of the network bandwidth. Further, our system model is based on blockchain, a disruptive technology that enables decentralization in data sharing. It mitigates the bottlenecks in centralized systems and achieves fine-grained access control to data.

"The fast development of Blockchain technology makes it widely applied in several fields of digital transactions, like e-government affairs and the protection of financial transactions. In this article, we propose a homomorphic encryption-based Blockchain for circuit copyright protection that effectively addresses the issues in the protection of circuit copyright transactions, such as low security of private data, low efficiency in transaction data storage, cooperation and supervision. First, we establish a homomorphic encryption-based mathematical model by utilizing Blockchain and intelligent contract, and next, the algorithms that include Blockchain generation, homomorphic chain encryption/decryption, and intelligent contract are designed. As the intelligent contract is correctly executed in Blockchain, a fully homomorphic encryption-based identity authentication protocol is tackled for Blockchain, given that it ensures the change operation of any third-party in Blockchain and realizes real-time verification. The system is apposite for circuit copyright protection in a blockchain network, due to the use of distributed identity authentication and real-time extensible storage improves the security and extensibility of blockchain-based circuit copyright protection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has reduced the transmission cost and improved the efficiency of data storage and supervision.

"Blockchain has attracted lots of attention in recent years. However, the performance of blockchain cannot meet the requirement of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the important bottlenecks of blockchain is the limited computing resources on a single server while executing transactions. To address this issue, we propose Aeolus blockchain to achieve the distributed execution of blockchain transactions. There are two key challenges to achieving this for IoT blockchain: transaction structure and state consistency. Facing these challenges, we first propose a distributed blockchain transaction structure, which imports extra parameters to divide the transaction execution into different stages to enable distributed execution. Second, we propose distributed state update sharding, which equips each blockchain peer with its own master and shard servers. In this way, each blockchain peer can be considered as a cluster that distributes the transaction to shorten the processing time and reach the consensus finally. We implement Aeolus on Go-Ethereum to evaluate its feasibility, on a testbed including 132 cloud servers. Our system runs stably for more than 8 h under the workload of 190 000 000 real-world user transactions.

"In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo’s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be “The DAO Attack” in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary’s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture.

"Pneumothorax is a common pulmonary disease that can lead to dyspnea and can be life-threatening. X-ray examination is the main means to diagnose this disease. Computer-aided diagnosis of pneumothorax on chest X-ray, as a prerequisite for a timely cure, has been widely studied, but it is still not satisfactory to achieve highly accurate results. In this paper, an image classification algorithm based on the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for high-resolution medical image analysis of pneumothorax X-rays, which features a Network In Network (NIN) for cleaning the data, random histogram equalization data augmentation processing, and a DCNN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively increase the correct diagnosis rate of pneumothorax, and the Area under Curve (AUC) of the test verified in the experiment is 0.9844 on ZJU-2 test data and 0.9906 on the ChestX-ray14, respectively. In addition, a large number of atmospheric pleura samples are visualized and analyzed based on the experimental results and in-depth learning characteristics of the algorithm. The analysis results verify the validity of feature extraction for the network. Combined with the results of these two aspects, the proposed X-ray image processing algorithm can effectively improve the classification accuracy of pneumothorax photographs.","[Yaqi Wang, Lingling Sun, Qun Jin]",Applied Mathematics (Q2); Biotechnology (Q2); Genetics (Q3),"[China, China, Japan]",19 April 2019,19,"[Key Lab of RF Circuits and Systems of Ministry of Education, Microelectronics CAD Center, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, Key Lab of RF Circuits and Systems of Ministry of Education, Microelectronics CAD Center, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, Department of Human Informatics and Cognitive Sciences, Faculty of Human Sciences, Waseda University, Tokorozawa, Japan]",April,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,Q2,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Key Lab of RF Circuits and Systems of Ministry of Education, Key Lab of RF Circuits and Systems of Ministry of Education, Department of Human Informatics and Cognitive Sciences]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ee2f
"In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China and has been reported in many countries with millions of people infected within only four months. Chest computed Tomography (CT) has proven to be a useful supplement to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and has been shown to have high sensitivity to diagnose this condition. Therefore, radiological examinations are becoming crucial in early examination of COVID-19 infection. Currently, CT findings have already been suggested as an important evidence for scientific examination of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. However, classification of patient from chest CT images is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network with mixture density network (DBM) model is proposed. To tune the hyperparameters of the DBM model, a Memetic Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments are drawn by considering the benchmark chest-Computed Tomography (chest-CT) images datasets. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed MADE-DBM model outperforms the competitive COVID-19 classification approaches in terms of various performance metrics. Therefore, the proposed MADE-DBM model can be used in real-time COVID-19 classification systems.","[Yadunath Pathak, Piyush Kumar Shukla, K. V.

"Future wireless networks will progressively displace service provisioning towards the edge to accommodate increasing growth in traffic. This paradigm shift calls for smart policies to efficiently share network resources and ensure service delivery. In this paper, we consider a cognitive dynamic network architecture CDNA where primary users PUs are rewarded for sharing their connectivities and acting as access points for secondary users SUs. CDNA creates opportunities for capacity increase by network-wide harvesting of unused data plans and spectrum from different operators. Different policies for data and spectrum trading are presented based on centralized, hybrid, and distributed schemes involving primary operator PO, secondary operator SO, and their respective end users. In these schemes, PO and SO progressively delegate trading to their end users and adopt more flexible cooperation agreements to reduce computational time and track available resources dynamically. A novel matching-with-pricing algorithm is presented to enable self-organized SU-PU associations, channel allocation and pricing for data and spectrum with low computational complexity. Since connectivity is provided by the actual users, the success of the underlying collaborative market relies on the trustworthiness of the connections.

"Low latency is highly desirable for cloud services. To achieve a low response time, stringent timing requirements are needed for task scheduling in a large-scale server farm spanning thousands of servers. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis for distributed Join-the-Idle-Queue JIQ, a promising new approximation of an idealized task-scheduling algorithm. In particular, we derive semi-closed form expressions for the delay performance of distributed JIQ, and we propose a new variant of distributed JIQ that offers clear advantages over alternative algorithms for large systems.","[Chunpu Wang, Chen Feng, Julian Cheng]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[Canada, Canada, Canada]",01 October 2018,1,"[School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada, School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada, School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada]",October,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Engineering, School of Engineering, School of Engineering]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7ee37
"Anomaly detection in communication networks is the first step in the challenging task of securing a network, as anomalies may indicate suspicious behaviors, attacks, network malfunctions, or failures. In this paper, we address the problem of not only detecting the anomalous events but also of attributing the anomaly to the flows causing it. To this end, we develop a new statistical decision theoretic framework for temporally correlated traffic in networks via Markov chain modeling. We first formulate the optimal anomaly detection problem via the generalized likelihood ratio test GLRT for our composite model. This results in a combinatorial optimization problem which is prohibitively expensive. We then develop two low-complexity anomaly detection algorithms. The first is based on the cross entropy CE method, which detects anomalies as well as attributes anomalies to flows. The second algorithm performs anomaly detection via GLRT on the aggregated flows transformation—a compact low-dimensional representation of the raw traffic flows. The two algorithms complement each other and allow the network operator to first activate the flow aggregation algorithm in order to quickly detect anomalies in the system. Once an anomaly has been detected, the operator can further investigate which specific flows are anomalous by running the CE-based algorithm. We perform extensive performance evaluations and experiment our algorithms on synthetic and semi-synthetic data, as well as on real Internet traffic data obtained from the MAWI archive, and finally make recommendations regarding their usability.","[Ido Nevat, Dinil Mon Divakaran, Sai Ganesh Nagarajan, Pengfei Zhang, Le Su, Li Ling Ko, Vrizlynn L.

"To tackle the contradiction between the computation intensive applications and the resource-hungry mobile user equipments UEs, mobile edge computing MEC has been provisioned as a promising solution, which enables the UEs to offload the tasks to the MEC servers. Considering the characteristics of small cell networks SCNs, integrating MEC into SCNs is natural. But in terms of the high interference, multi-access property, and limited resources of small cell base stations SBSs, an efficient computation offloading scheme is essential. However, there still lack comprehensive studies on this problem in the densely deployed SCNs. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient computation offloading management scheme in the MEC system with SCNs. The aim of this paper is to minimize the energy consumption of all UEs via jointly optimizing computation offloading decision making, spectrum, power, and computation resource allocation. Specially, the UEs need not only to decide whether to offload but also to determine where to offload. First, we present the computation offloading model and formulate this problem as a mix integer non-linear programming problem, which is NP-hard. Taking advantages of genetic algorithm GA and particle swarm optimization PSO, we design a suboptimal algorithm named as hierarchical GA and PSO-based computation algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, the convergence of this algorithm is studied by simulation, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing with the other baseline algorithms.","[Fengxian Guo, Heli Zhang, Hong Ji, Xi Li, Victor C.

"Recently, network function virtualization has been proposed to transform from network hardware appliances to software middleboxes. Normally, a demand needs to invoke several virtual network functions VNFs following the order determined by the service chain along a routing path. In this paper, we study the joint problem of the VNF placement and path selection to better utilize the network. We discover that the relation between the link and server usage plays a crucial role in the problem. Inspired by stress testing, we first propose a systematic way to elastically tune the link and server usage of each demand based on the network status and properties of demands. In particular, we compute a proper routing path length, and decide, for each VNF in the service chain, whether to use additional server resources or to reuse resources provided by existing servers. We then propose a chain deployment algorithm that follows the guidance of this link and server usage. Via simulations, we show that our design effectively adapts resource allocation to network dynamics and, hence, serves more demands than other heuristics.","[Tung-Wei Kuo, Bang-Heng Liou, Kate Ching-Ju Lin, Ming-Jer Tsai]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[Taiwan, Taiwan, Taiwan, Taiwan]",01 August 2018,1,"[Department of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan, Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan]",August,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7ee3c
"Location-aware viral marketing is crucial in modern commercial applications for attracting customers to certain points of interests. Prior works are mainly based on formulating it into a location-aware influence maximization problem in Geo-social Networks GSNs, where $K$ initial seed individuals are selected in hope of maximizing the number of final influenced users. In this paper, we present the first look into the group-level location promotion, which can potentially enhance its performance, with the phenomenon that users belonging to the same geo-community share similar moving preferences. We propose GLP, a new and novel framework of group-level location promotion by virtue of geo-communities, each of which is treated as a group in GSNs. Aiming to attract more users to designated locations, GLP firstly carries out user grouping through an iterative learning approach based on information extraction from massive check-ins records. The advantage of GLP is three-folded: i by aggregating movements of group members, GLP significantly avoids the sparsity and sporadicity of individual check-ins, and thus obtains more reliable mobility models; ii by generalizing a new group-level social graph, GLP can exponentially reduce the computational complexity of seed nodes selection that is algorithmically executed by a greedy algorithm; iii in comparison with prior individual-level cases, GLP is theoretically demonstrated to drastically increase influence spread under the same given budget. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the GLP outperforms four baselines, with notably up to 10 times larger influence spread and 100 times faster seed selection over two individual-level cases, meanwhile verifying the impact of group numbers in final influence spread.","[Xudong Wu, Luoyi Fu, Yuhang Yao, Xinzhe Fu, Xinbing Wang, Guihai Chen]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China, China]",01 December 2018,1,"[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China]",December,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7ee3d
"This paper studies the problem of compressing the forwarding information base FIB, but taking a wider perspective. Indeed, FIB compression goes beyond sheer compression, as the gain in memory use obtained from the compression has consequences on the updates that will have to be applied to the compressed FIB. We are interested in the situation where forwarding rules can change over time, e.g., due to border gateway protocol BGP route updates. Accordingly, we frame FIB compression as an online problem and design competitive online algorithms to solve it. In contrast to prior work which mostly focused on static optimizations, we study an online variant of the problem where routes can change over time and where the number of updates to the FIB is taken into account explicitly. The reason to consider this version of the problem is that leveraging temporal locality while accounting for the number of FIB updates helps to keep routers CPU load low and reduces the number of FIB updates to be transferred, e.g., from the network-attached software-defined network controller to a remote switch. This paper introduces a formal model which is an interesting generalization of several classic online aggregation problems. Our main contribution is an Ow-competitive algorithm, where ${w}$ is the length of an IP address. We also derive a lower bound which shows that our result is asymptotically optimal within a natural class of algorithms, based on so-called sticks.","[Marcin Bienkowski, Nadi Sarrar, Stefan Schmid, Steve Uhlig]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[Poland, Germany, Austria, U.K.]",01 February 2018,1,"[Computer Science Institute, University of Wrocław, Wrocław, Poland, Department of Telecommunication Systems, TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany, Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K.]",February,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Computer Science Institute, Department of Telecommunication Systems, Faculty of Computer Science, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7ee3e
"How to combine multiple data-streams for transmission in aggregate is a very interesting problem, especially for the emerging software-defined networks nowadays. The conventional packet-based protocols cannot provide the flexibility for combining data-streams in the ad hoc nature. If the number of data-streams changes over time, the existing packet formats cannot handle the transmission of multiple data-streams effectively. The effectiveness is measured by two performance metrics, namely coding efficiency and data-transmission intermittency. We propose a new software-defined multiplexing code (SDMC) approach, which can combine (multiplex) multiple data-streams easily and is much more effective than the conventional packet-based method. Three SDMC schemes (distributed, hierarchical, and hybrid) are compared theoretically and by simulation. A trade-off between these two performance metrics can be found when one selects one of the three SDMC schemes for combining multiple data-streams. The hierarchical SDMC scheme brings about the highest coding efficiency while the hybrid SDMC scheme suffers from the smallest overall intermittency.","[Elaine Y.-N. Sun, Hsiao-Chun Wu, Scott C.-H.

At the heart of TipTop lies an innovative technique that reduces the number of samples as much as possible. This allows us to exactly solve CTVM on a much smaller space of generated samples using integer programming.

"With the increasing diffusion of Internet probing technologies, a large amount of regularly collected traceroutes are available for Internet service providers ISPs at low cost. We show how it is possible, given solely an arbitrary set of traceroutes, to spot routing paths that change similarly over time and aggregate them into inferred routing events. With respect to previous works, our approach does not require any knowledge of the network, does not need complex integration of several data sources, and exploits the asynchronicity of measurements to accurately position events in time. The formal model at the basis of our methodology revolves around the notion of empathy, a relation that binds similarly behaving traceroutes. The correctness and completeness of our approach are based on structural properties that are easily expressed in terms of empathic measurements. We perform experiments with data from public measurement infrastructures like RIPE Atlas, showing the effectiveness of our algorithm in distilling significant events from a large amount of traceroute data. We also validate the accuracy of the inferred events against ground-truth knowledge of routing changes originating from induced and spontaneous routing events.

Hardware fingerprinting has been demonstrated to be a surprising and effective source for identifying/authenticating devices. In this work, we show that a few data samples collected from the motion sensors are enough to uniquely identify the source mobile device, i.e., the raw motion sensor data serves as a fingerprint of the mobile device. Specifically, we first analytically understand the fingerprinting capacity using features extracted from hardware data. To capture the essential device feature automatically, we design a multi-LSTM neural network to fingerprint mobile device sensor in real-life uses, instead of using handcrafted features by existing work. Using data collected over 6 months, for arbitrary user movements, our fingerprinting model achieves 93% F-score given one second data, while the state-of-the-art work achieves 79% F-score.

"In many real-world networks, entities of different types usually form an evolving network with hybrid interactions. However, how to theoretically model such networks, along with quantitive characterizations, remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we develop a novel evolving model, which, as validated by our empirical results, can well capture some basic properties such as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter, and community structure embodied in most real datasets. Particularly, two types of results are presented in this paper. First, our proposed model, namely, evolving K-Graph, consists of $K$ -node sets representing $K$ different types of entities. The hybrid interactions among entities, based on whether they belong to the same type, are classified into inter-type and intra-type ones that are, respectively, characterized by two joint graphs evolving over time. Following our newly proposed mechanism called interactive-evolution, potential connections can be established among nodes with common features and further form a positive feedback. The superiorities of our model are three folded: good capture of realistic networks, mathematical tractability, and efficient implementation. Second, by analytical derivations, along with empirical validation on real datasets, we disclose two aspects of network properties: basic ones as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter and community structure, as well as a distinctive one, that is, positive correlation observed in real networks, implying that a hub in one inter-type relationship network also has many neighbors in another one. An additional interesting finding is that through further comparison of models with or without interactive-evolution, the former one leads to an even earlier occurrence of network connectivity.","[Jiaqi Liu, Luoyi Fu, Yuhang Yao, Xinzhe Fu, Xinbing Wang, Guihai Chen]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China, China]",01 February 2019,1,"[Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China]",February,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ee44
"Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based ledger and the corresponding consensus algorithm has been identified as a promising technology for Internet of Things (IoT). Compared with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that have been widely used in blockchain, the consensus mechanism designed on DAG structure (simply called as DAG consensus) can overcome some shortcomings such as high resource consumption, high transaction fee, low transaction throughput and long confirmation delay. However, the theoretic analysis on the DAG consensus is an untapped venue to be explored. To this end, based on one of the most typical DAG consensuses, Tangle, we investigate the impact of network load on the performance and security of the DAG-based ledger. Considering unsteady network load, we first propose a Markov chain model to capture the behavior of DAG consensus process under dynamic load conditions. The key performance metrics, i.e., cumulative weight and confirmation delay are analysed based on the proposed model. Then, we leverage a stochastic model to analyse the probability of a successful double-spending attack in different network load regimes. The results can provide an insightful understanding of DAG consensus process, e.g., how the network load affects the confirmation delay and the probability of a successful attack. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the trade-off between security level and confirmation delay, which can act as a guidance for practical deployment of DAG-based ledgers.","[Yixin Li, Bin Cao, Mugen Peng, Long Zhang, Lei Zhang, Daquan Feng]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, U.K., China]",17 August 2020,17,"[State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K., Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Digital Creative Technology and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China]",August,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, James Watt School of Engineering, Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Digital Creative Technology and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ee45
"Mining pools have become dominant in today&#x2019;s bitcoin mining network, where miners can pool their powers together for reduced variance of block mining and steadier stream of potential income. Along with the continuous evolvement of mining pools are the increasingly intense competitions among them. Recent empirical studies have shown that the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one of the most common ways for competing mining pools to sabotage the rivals and earn illegitimate rewards. Existing efforts have been made on using static game models to analyze the interactions between mining pools, and derive the Nash Equilibrium and optimal attacking strategies in a one-time static context. To better understand the impact of such DDoS attacks, in this paper, we take a starkly different approach, and for the first time address the dynamics in mining pool attacks. Specifically, we start by formulating the interactive competition among mining pools as a general-sum stochastic game. Then we propose an efficient Nash learning algorithm to obtain the near optimal attacking strategy that maximizes the expected long-term utility.

"The introduction of software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a new network paradigm for network innovations. By decoupling the control plane from the data plane in traditional networks, SDN provides high programmability to control and manage networks. However, the communication between the two planes can be a bottleneck of the whole network. SDN-aimed DoS attacks can cause long packet delay and high packet loss rate by using massive table-miss packets to jam links between the two planes. To detect and mitigate SDN-aimed DoS attacks, this paper presents FloodDefender, an efficient and protocol-independent defense framework for SDN/OpenFlow networks. FloodDefender stands between the controller platform and other controller apps, and conforms to the OpenFlow policy without additional devices. The detection module in FloodDefender utilizes new frequency features to precisely identify SDN-aimed DoS attacks. The mitigation module uses three new techniques to efficiently mitigate attack traffic: table-miss engineering to prevent the communication bandwidth from being exhausted; packet filter to filter out attack traffic and save computational resources of the control plane; and flow rule management to eliminate most of useless flow entries in the switch flow table. Our evaluation on a prototype implementation of FloodDefender shows that the defense framework can precisely identify and efficiently mitigate the SDN-aimed DoS attacks with very little overhead.","[Shang Gao, Zhe Peng, Bin Xiao, Aiqun Hu, Yubo Song, Kui Ren]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, China, China]",16 June 2020,16,"[Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China]",June,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Computing, Department of Computer Science, Department of Computing, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, School of Computer Science and Technology]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ee47
"The proliferation of innovative mobile services such as augmented reality, networked gaming, and autonomous driving has spurred a growing need for low-latency access to computing resources that cannot be met solely by existing centralized cloud systems. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the execution of computing tasks at the network edge, in proximity to the end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial amounts of data need to be pre-stored to enable service execution, and that many emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap, we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in dense MEC networks with multidimensional constraints. We show that this problem generalizes several well-known placement and routing problems and propose an algorithm that achieves close-to-optimal performance using a randomized rounding technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively utilize available storage, computation, and communication resources to maximize the number of requests served by low-latency edge cloud servers.","[Konstantinos Poularakis, Jaime Llorca, Antonia M.

"Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) chips are used to store Forwarding Information Bases (FIB) in modern routers. TCAM provides next-hop lookup for IP packets at the line-rate. However, TCAM is expensive and energy-consuming; in addition, the constant FIB growth may lead to TCAM overflow problem. Yet only a small portion of FIB entries carries the most of network traffic. Thus, FIB caching, namely, installing the most popular entries in a fast memory, e.g., TCAM, may significantly minimize TCAM usage. To date, FIB caching architecture has not been widely deployed in backbone routers due to high cache-miss latency and the lack of an efficient cache replacement strategy. In this work, we leverage the concept of the programmable data plane to design a Programmable FIB Caching Architecture (PFCA) with two levels of cache. We present a pipeline-based algorithm to detect the least popular prefixes in a cache for a victim selection. We tested the prototype of PFCA using real traffic traces and an FIB with more than 599K entries, and showed that PFCA can be implemented using P4 programmable data plane language. Our results show that PFCA achieves 99.8% hit ratio for Level-1 cache with 20K entries and nearly 99.9% hit ratio for Level-2 cache with 40K entries. We also demonstrate that PFCA significantly reduces the number of BGP updates in the cache and thus makes the cache more stable.","[Garegin Grigoryan, Yaoqing Liu, Minseok Kwon]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[USA, USA, USA]",17 August 2020,17,"[Department of Computer Science, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA, Department of Computer Science, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teaneck, NJ, USA, Department of Computer Science, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA]",August,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ee49

This problem is important because of high vulnerabilities in wireless communications and an additional security vulnerability when some users collude with the adversary.

"Homomorphic signature is an extremely important public key authentication technique for network coding to defend against pollution attacks. As a public key cryptographic primitive, it also encounters the same problem of how to confirm the relationship between some public key <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$pk$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and the identity <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ID$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of its owner. In the setting of distributed network coding, the intermediate and destination nodes need to use the public key of source node S to check the validity of vector-signature pairs. Therefore, the binding of S and its corresponding public key becomes crucial. The popular and traditional solution is based on certificates which are issued by a trusted certification authority (CA) center. However, the generation and management of certificates is extremely cumbersome. Hence, in recent work, Lin <italic>et al.</italic> proposed a new notion of identity-based homomorphic signature, which intends to avoid using certificates. But the key escrow problem is inevitable for identity-based primitives. In this article, we propose another new notion (for network coding): certificateless homomorphic signature (CLHS), which is a compromise for the above two techniques. In particular, we first describe the definition and security model of certificateless homomorphic signature. Then based on bilinear map and the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption, give a concrete implementation and detailedly analyze its security.

"BGP reconvergence events involving a large number of prefixes may result in the loss of large amounts of traffic. Based on the observation that a very small number of prefixes carries the vast majority of traffic, we propose Power Prefixes Prioritization (PPP) to ensure the routes of these popular BGP prefixes converge first. By doing so, we significantly reduce the amount of traffic lost during reconvergence events. To achieve this, PPP obtains an ordered list of popular prefixes through traffic inspection, and configures the resulting prefix rank in the BGP routers to prioritize the processing and advertisement of BGP routes. We model the benefits of PPP over traditional BGP processing in terms of traffic loss for both generic and a Zipf traffic distribution, and we consider the impact of sampling in the process of obtaining the prefix rank. Applying the mechanism to real traffic traces obtained from WIDE, we show that PPP reduces the amount of traffic lost by an order of magnitude, even when we configure it to use conservative sampling rates. We prototype our proposal in Quagga to show the feasibility of its implementation, and we observe similar traffic loss reduction. PPP can be deployed incrementally, as it is implemented purely as a change in the router-internal BGP processing behavior.","[Juan Brenes, Alberto García-Martínez, Marcelo Bagnulo, Andra Lutu, Cristel Pelsser]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, France]",16 June 2020,16,"[Department of Telematics Engineering, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, Department of Telematics Engineering, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, Department of Telematics Engineering, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, Telefonica Research, Telefónica Investigación y Desarrollo, Barcelona, Spain, ICube, University of Strasbourg, Illkirch, France]",June,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Telematics Engineering, Department of Telematics Engineering, Department of Telematics Engineering, Telefonica Research, ICube]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ee4d
"Mobile crowdsensing is a new paradigm in which a requester can recruit a group of mobile users via a platform and coordinate them to perform some sensing tasks by using their smartphones. In mobile crowdsensing, each user might perform multiple tasks with different sensing qualities. Meanwhile, the users participating in the crowdsensing will ask for sufficient rewards to compensate for their expenditures. Hence, an important problem is how to recruit the users with minimum cost while achieving a satisfactory sensing quality for each task. Furthermore, in order to ease users&#x2019; worries about privacy disclosures, the user recruitment process needs to protect each user&#x2019;s sensing quality and recruitment cost information from being revealed to other users or to the platform. In this paper, we propose two secure user recruitment problems for the cases where the recruitment costs of users are homogeneous and heterogeneous. After proving the NP-hardness of the problems, we design two secure user recruitment protocols by using secret sharing scheme. Both of the proposed protocols adopt greedy strategies, which can recruit nearly optimal users while ensuring that the total sensing quality of each task is no less than a given threshold. The difference lies in that the two greedy strategies are based on two unique utility functions. We analyze the approximation ratios of the two protocols and prove the security under the semi-honest model. Finally, we demonstrate the significant performance of the proposed protocols through extensive simulations and executions on real smartphones.","[Mingjun Xiao, Guoju Gao, Jie Wu, Sheng Zhang, Liusheng Huang]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, USA, China, China]",15 April 2020,15,"[School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, School of Computer Science and Technology, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China]",April,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, Department of Computer and Information Sciences, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ee4e
"The paper proposes a novel framework based on the contract theory and Lyapunov optimization for content sharing in a wireless content delivery network (CDN) with edge caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. The network is partitioned into a set of clusters. In a cluster, users can share contents via D2D links in coordination with the cluster head. Upon receiving the content request from any user in its cluster, the cluster head either delivers the content itself or forwards the request to another node, i.e., a base station (BS) or another user in the cluster. The content access at the BS and in each cluster is modeled as a queuing system, where arrivals represent the content requests directed to respective nodes. The objective is to assign content delivery nodes to stabilize all queues while minimizing the time-averaged network cost given incomplete information about content sharing costs of the users and unknown distribution of the network state defined by users' locations and their cached/requested content. The proposed framework allows the users to truthfully reveal their content sharing expenditures, minimize the time-averaged network cost and stabilize the queuing system representing the CDN. Based on this framework, a distributed content access and delivery algorithm where the node assignments are made by every cluster head independently is developed. It is shown that the algorithm converges to the optimal policy with the trade-off in total queue backlog and achieves a superior performance compared with some other D2D content sharing policies.","[Alia Asheralieva, Dusit Niyato]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, Singapore]",16 June 2020,16,"[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore]",June,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Computer Science and Engineering]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7ee4f
"The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth in cryptocurrencies, but the blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have also raised many concerns, among which a crucial one is the scalability issue. Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even the leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve the cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers the off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations.

This requirement of storing the entire ledger incurs a high storage cost that grows undesirably large for high transaction rates and large networks.

In addition, the storage code ensures the security of the storage from active adversaries that may aim to corrupt prior transactions by altering copies of the ledger.

"In Named Data Networking, cache pollution, cache poisoning and interest flooding are three popular types of attacks that can drastically degrade the network performance. However, previous methods for mitigating these attacks are not sufficiently effective or efficient. Also, they cannot simultaneously handle the three attacks, or the case that core routers or edge routers are compromised. To handle these problems, we propose an effective and lightweight countermeasure scheme. It consists of token-based router monitoring policy (TRM), hierarchical consensus-based trust management (HCT), and popularity-based probabilistic caching and caching replacement policy (PPC). In TRM, each edge router monitors and evaluates each data requester&#x2019;s probability of launching the cache pollution attack and each data provider&#x2019;s probability of launching the cache poisoning attack, and accordingly assigns, rewards and penalizes tokens to them to control their data request and data provision activities. Thus, the interest flooding attack can also be mitigated by limiting the consumption of tokens. In HCT, each core router manages its directly connected edge routers using TRM, and the core routers trust each other through adopting the concept of consensus in Blockchain. Thus, the edge and core routers executing monitoring and evaluation are trustable. PPC uses probabilistic caching and caching replacement based on the popularity of received content to further mitigate the attacks and reduce caching and data verification overhead. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme has better performance, in terms of interest satisfaction ratio and average end-to-end delay than current mechanisms.","[Dapeng Qu, Guoxin Lv, Shijun Qu, Haiying Shen, Yue Yang, Zhaoyang Heng]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, China, USA, China, China]",26 October 2021,26,"[College of Information, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China, College of Information, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China, College of Information, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China, Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA, College of Information, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China, College of Information, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China]",October,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[College of Information, College of Information, College of Information, Department of Computer Science, College of Information, College of Information]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee52
"To detect fraudulent TLS server certificates and improve the accountability of certification authorities (CAs), certificate transparency (CT) is proposed to record certificates in publicly-visible logs, from which the monitors fetch all certificates and watch for suspicious ones. However, if the monitors, either domain owners themselves or third-party services, fail to return a complete set of certificates issued for a domain of interest, potentially fraudulent certificates may not be detected and then the CT framework becomes less reliable. This paper presents the first systematic study on CT monitors. We analyze the data in 88 public logs and the services of 5 active third-party monitors regarding 3,000,431 certificates of 6,000 selected Alexa Top-1M websites. We find that although CT allows ordinary domain owners to act as monitors, it is impractical for them to perform reliable processing by themselves, due to the rapidly increasing volume of certificates in public logs (e.g., on average about 5 million records or 28.29 GB daily for the minimal set of logs that need to be monitored in 2018, or more than 7 million records per day in 2020, according to the Chrome CT policy). Moreover, our study discloses that (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${a}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) none of the third-party monitors guarantees to return the complete set of certificates for a domain, and (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${b}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) for some domains, even the union of the certificates returned by the five third-party monitors can probably be incomplete. As a result, the certificates accepted by CT-enabled browsers are not actually visible to the claimed domain owners, even when CT is adopted with well-functioning logs. The risk of invisible fraudulent certificates in public logs raises doubts on the reliability of CT in practice.","[Bingyu Li, Jingqiang Lin, Fengjun Li, Qiongxiao Wang, Wei Wang, Qi Li]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, USA, China, China, China]",10 November 2021,10,"[School of Cyber Science and Technology, Beihang University, Beijing, China, School of Cyber Security, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace, and the Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China]",November,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Cyber Science and Technology, School of Cyber Security, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee53
"Unlike general routing strategies, network coding (NC) can combine encoding functions with multi-path propagation over a network. This allows network capacity to be achieved to support complex security solutions. Moreover, NC has intrinsic security advantages against passive attacks over traditional routing techniques. However, due to the transmission of the global encoding kernels, the system is fragile to eavesdropping attacks with multiple probes. This paper proposes a generic unicast secure transmission scheme based on random linear network coding (RLNC). Specifically, the intended receiver generates a random matrix upon receiving the request from the source node, and then transmits each row vector of this matrix over a link reversely to the source node. Each intermediate node rearranges all received vectors to form a matrix by row, and then post-multiplies its local encoding kernel by this matrix to obtain a new matrix. Similarly, each row vector of the new matrix is reversely transmitted over a link to the source node. This procedure is performed until we have the source node, where the generalized inverse of the received matrix (or part of it) can be used as its local encoding kernel. Hence, the intended receiver can use the generated matrix (or the corresponding part) to decode the received data packets directly. We also analyze the security to demonstrate that the proposed scheme is at least as secure as other methods against wiretapping attacks. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme to demonstrate its utility.","[Renyong Wu, Jieming Ma, Zhixiang Tang, Xiehua Li]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, China, China]",10 November 2021,10,"[College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China]",November,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee54
"In this paper, we investigate distributed broadcasting in dynamic networks, where the topology changes continually over time. We propose a network model that captures the dynamicity caused by both churn and mobility of nodes. In contrast to existing work on dynamic networks, our model defines the dynamicity in terms of localized topological changes in the vicinity of each node, rather than a global view of the whole network. Obviously, a local dynamic model suits distributed algorithms better than a global one. The proposed dynamic model uses the more realistic SINR model to depict wireless interference, instead of oversimplified graph-based models adopted in most existing work.

"Content replication and name-based routing lead to a natural multi-source and multipath transmission paradigm in NDN. Due to the unique connectionless characteristic of NDN, current end-to-end multipath congestion control schemes (e.g. MPTCP) cannot be used directly on NDN. This paper proposes a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) model to formulate multi-source and multipath transmission in NDN with in-network caches. From this model, a family of receiver-driven transmission solutions can be derived, named as path-specified congestion control. The path-specified congestion control enables content consumers to separate the traffic control on each path, which consequently facilitates fair and efficient bandwidth sharing amongst all consumers. As a specific instance, a Delay-based Path-specified Congestion Control Protocol (DPCCP) is presented, which utilizes queuing delays as signals to measure and control congestion levels of different bottlenecks. In addition, a set of high-performance congestion control laws are designed to accelerate bandwidth and fairness convergence towards the optimum defined by the NUM model. Finally, DPCCP is compared with state-of-the-art solutions. The experimental evaluations show that DPCCP outperforms existing solutions in terms of bandwidth utilization, convergence time and packet loss.","[Yuhang Ye, Brian Lee, Ronan Flynn, Jin Xu, Guiming Fang, Yuansong Qiao]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, China, China, Ireland]",24 June 2021,24,"[Software Research Institute, Athlone Institute of Technology, Athlone, Ireland, Software Research Institute, Athlone Institute of Technology, Athlone, Ireland, Software Research Institute, Athlone Institute of Technology, Athlone, Ireland, School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, Software Research Institute, Athlone Institute of Technology, Athlone, Ireland]",June,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Software Research Institute, Software Research Institute, Software Research Institute, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Institute of Software, Software Research Institute]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee56
"With recent advancements in edge computing capabilities, there has been a significant increase in utilizing the edge cloud for event-driven and time-sensitive computations. However, large-scale edge computing networks can suffer substantially from unpredictable and unreliable computing resources which can result in high variability of service quality. We consider the problem of computation offloading over unknown edge cloud networks with a sequence of timely computation jobs. Motivated by the MapReduce computation paradigm, we assume that each computation job can be partitioned to smaller Map functions which are processed at the edge, and the Reduce function is computed at the user after the Map results are collected from the edge nodes. We model the service quality of each edge device as function of context. The user decides the computations to offload to each device with the goal of receiving a recoverable set of computation results in the given deadline. By leveraging the <italic>coded computing</italic> framework in order to tackle failures or stragglers in computation, we formulate this problem using contextual-combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CC-MAB), and aim to maximize the cumulative expected reward. We propose an online learning policy called <italic>online coded edge computing policy</italic>, which provably achieves asymptotically-optimal performance in terms of regret loss compared with the optimal offline policy for the proposed CC-MAB problem. In terms of the cumulative reward, it is shown that the online coded edge computing policy significantly outperforms other benchmarks via numerical studies.","[Chien-Sheng Yang, Ramtin Pedarsani, A.

"Online social networks provide a convenient platform for the spread of rumors, which could lead to serious aftermaths such as economic losses and public panic. The classical rumor blocking problem aims to launch a set of nodes as a positive cascade to compete with misinformation in order to limit the spread of rumors. However, most of the related researches were based on a one-dimensional diffusion model. In reality, there is more than one feature associated with an object. A user's impression on this object is determined not just by one feature but by her overall evaluation of all features associated with it. Thus, the influence spread of this object can be decomposed into the spread of multiple features. Based on that, we design a multi-feature diffusion model (MF-model) in this paper and formulate a multi-feature rumor blocking (MFRB) problem on a multi-layer network structure according to this model. To solve the MFRB problem, we design a creative sampling method called Multi-Sampling, which can be applied to this multi-layer network structure. Then, we propose a Revised-IMM algorithm and obtain a satisfactory approximate solution to MFRB. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm by conducting experiments on real datasets, which shows the effectiveness of our Revised-IMM and its advantage to their baseline algorithms.","[Jianxiong Guo, Tiantian Chen, Weili Wu]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[USA, USA, USA]",16 February 2021,16,"[Department of Computer Science, Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA, Department of Computer Science, Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA, Department of Computer Science, Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA]",February,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee59
"The ability of a P2P network to scale its throughput up in proportion to the arrival rate of peers has recently been shown to be crucially dependent on the chunk sharing policy employed. Some policies can result in low frequencies of a particular chunk, known as the missing chunk syndrome, which can dramatically reduce throughput and lead to instability of the system. For instance, commonly used policies that nominally &#x201C;boost&#x201D; the sharing of infrequent chunks such as the well-known rarest-first algorithm have been shown to be unstable. We take a complementary viewpoint, and instead consider a policy that simply prevents the sharing of the most frequent chunk(s), that we call mode-suppression. We also consider a more general version that suppresses the mode only if the mode frequency is larger than the lowest frequency by a fixed threshold. We prove the stability of mode-suppression using Lyapunov techniques, and use a Kingman bound argument to show that the total download time does not increase with peer arrival rate. We then design versions of mode-suppression that sample a small number of peers at each time, and construct noisy mode estimates by aggregating these samples over time. We show numerically that mode suppression stabilizes and outperforms all other recently proposed chunk sharing algorithms, and via integration into BitTorrent implementation operating over the ns-3 that it ensures stable, low sojourn time operation in a real-world setting.","[Vamseedhar Reddyvari, Sarat Chandra Bobbili, Parimal Parag, Srinivas Shakkottai]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[USA, India, India, USA]",15 December 2021,15,"[Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA]",December,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Texas A&M University, Indian Institute of Science, Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee5a
"Terahertz (THz)-band communications have been envisioned as a key technology to support ultra-high-data-rate applications in 5G-beyond (or 6G) wireless networks. Compared to the microwave and mmWave bands, the main challenges with the THz band are in its i) large path loss hence limited network coverage and ii) visible-light-like propagation characteristics hence poor support of mobility in blockage-rich environments. This paper studies quantitatively the applicability of THz-band communications in blockage-rich mobile environments, focusing on a new network scenario called <italic>FlyTera</italic>.

"In presence of multiple failures affecting their network infrastructure, operators are faced with the Progressive Network Recovery (PNR) problem, i.e., deciding the best sequence of repairs during recovery. With incoming deployments of 5G networks, PNR must evolve to incorporate new recovery opportunities offered by network slicing. In this study, we introduce the new problem of Progressive Slice Recovery (PSR), which is addressed with eight different strategies, i.e., allowing or not to change slice embedding during the recovery, and/or by enforcing different versions of slice connectivity (i.e., network vs. content connectivity). We propose a comprehensive PSR scheme, which can be applied to all recovery strategies and achieves fast recovery of slices. We first prove the PSR&#x2019;s NP-hardness and design an integer linear programming (ILP) model, which can obtain the best recovery sequence and is extensible for all the recovery strategies. Then, to address scalability issues of the ILP model, we devise an efficient two-phases progressive slice recovery (2-phase PSR) meta-heuristic algorithm, small optimality gap, consisting of two main steps: i) determination of recovery sequence, achieved through a linear-programming relaxation that works in polynomial time; and ii) slice-embedding recovery, for which we design an auxiliary-graph-based column generation to re-embed failed slice nodes/links to working substrate elements within a given number of actions. Numerical results compare the different strategies and validate that amount of recovered slices can be improved up to 50&#x0025; if operators decide to reconfigure only few slice nodes and guarantee content connectivity.","[Qiaolun Zhang, Omran Ayoub, Jun Wu, Francesco Musumeci, Gaolei Li, Massimo Tornatore]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[Italy, Switzerland, China, Italy, China, Italy]",07 December 2021,7,"[Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, Department of Innovative Technologies, University of Applied Sciences of Southern Switzerland, Lugano, Switzerland, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy]",December,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Department of Electronics, Department of Innovative Technologies, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, Department of Electronics, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security, Department of Electronics]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee5c
"Public-key certificate validation is an important building block for various security protocols for IoT devices, such as secure channel establishment, handshaking, and verifying sensing data authenticity from cloud storage. However, certification validation incurs non-trivial overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices, because it either brings long latency or large cache space. This work proposes to utilize the power of distributed caching and explores the feasibility of using the cache spaces on all IoT devices as a large pool to store validated certificates. We design a Collaborative Certificate Validation (CCV) protocol including a memory-efficient and fast locator for certificate holders, a trust model to evaluate the trustworthiness of devices, and a protocol suite for dynamic update and certificate revocation. Evaluation results show that CCV only uses less than 25% validation time and reduces &gt;90% decryption operations on each device, compared to a recent method.

"Network-wide monitoring is important for many network functions. Due to the need of sampling to reduce high measurement cost, system failure, and unavoidable data transmission loss, network monitoring systems suffer from the incompleteness of network monitoring data. Different from the traditional network monitoring data estimation problem which aims to infer all missing monitoring data entries with incomplete measurement data, we study a challenging problem of inferring the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest monitoring data entries. The recent study shows it is promising to more accurately interpolate the missing data with a 3-D tensor compared to that based on a 2-D matrix. Taking full advantage of the multilinear structures, we apply tensor completion to first recover the missing data and then find the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> data entries. To reduce the computational overhead, we propose a novel discrete tensor completion model which uses binary codes to represent the factor matrices. Based on the model, we further propose three novel techniques to speed up the whole top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> entry inference process: a discrete optimization algorithm to train the binary factor matrices, bit operations to facilitate quick missing data inference, and simplifying the finding of top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest entries with binary code partition. In our discrete tensor completion model, only one bit is needed to represent the entry in the factor matrices instead of a real value (32 bits) needed in traditional tensor completion model, thus the storage cost is reduced significantly. To quickly infer the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest data entries when measurement data arrive sequentially, we also propose a sliding window based online algorithm using the discrete tensor completion model.

"Many applications such as smart metering and location based services pose strong privacy requirements but achieving privacy protection at the client side is a non-trial problem as payment for the services must be computed by the server at the end of each billing period. In this paper, we propose a privacy preservation and billing scheme termed PPDIR based on delayed information release. PPDIR relies on a novel group signature mechanism and the asymmetric Rabin cryptosystem to protect the privacy of the clients and their requests, to achieve accountability and non-repudiation, and to shift the computational complexity to the server side. It adopts a secret token for anonymity and the token is updated for each client at the beginning of each billing period and securely released only to the server at the end of the billing period. Such a strategy can prevent the server from linking a client&#x2019;s requests made at different billing periods. It also prevents any adversary from linking any request to any client. Note that the server is able to figure out all requests made by a client within a billing period after receiving the delayed token, which is unavoidable for billing purpose. We prove the security properties of the group signature scheme, and analyze the security strength of PPDIR. Our study indicates that PPDIR can achieve privacy-preservation, confidentiality, non-repudiation, accountability, and other security objectives.

"The shared nature of the wireless medium induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgment.

TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification. Evaluation results show that TCP-TACK achieves significant advantages over legacy TCP in WLAN scenarios due to less contention between data packets and ACKs. Specifically, TCP-TACK reduces over 90&#x0025; of ACKs and also obtains an improvement of up to 28&#x0025; on goodput.

"There is an increasing interest in a fast-growing machine learning technique called Federated Learning (FL), in which the model training is distributed over mobile user equipment (UEs), exploiting UEs' local computation and training data. Despite its advantages such as preserving data privacy, FL still has challenges of heterogeneity across UEs' data and physical resources. To address these challenges, we first propose FEDL, a FL algorithm which can handle heterogeneous UE data without further assumptions except strongly convex and smooth loss functions. We provide a convergence rate characterizing the trade-off between local computation rounds of each UE to update its local model and global communication rounds to update the FL global model. We then employ FEDL in wireless networks as a resource allocation optimization problem that captures the trade-off between FEDL convergence wall clock time and energy consumption of UEs with heterogeneous computing and power resources. Even though the wireless resource allocation problem of FEDL is non-convex, we exploit this problem's structure to decompose it into three sub-problems and analyze their closed-form solutions as well as insights into problem design. Finally, we empirically evaluate the convergence of FEDL with PyTorch experiments, and provide extensive numerical results for the wireless resource allocation sub-problems. Experimental results show that FEDL outperforms the vanilla FedAvg algorithm in terms of convergence rate and test accuracy in various settings.","[Canh T. Dinh, Nguyen H. Tran, Minh N. H.

"Bitcoin is the leading example of a blockchain application that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a trusted third party. This paper considers possible attacks related to the decentralized network architecture of Bitcoin. We perform a data driven study of Bitcoin and present possible attacks based on spatial and temporal characteristics of its network. Towards that, we revisit the prior work, dedicated to the study of centralization of Bitcoin nodes over the Internet, through a fine-grained analysis of network distribution, and highlight the increasing centralization of the Bitcoin network over time. As a result, we show that Bitcoin is vulnerable to spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, and logical partitioning attacks with an increased attack feasibility due to the network dynamics.

"Truth discovery is an effective paradigm which could reveal the truth from crowdsouced data with conflicts, enabling data-driven decision-making systems to make quick and smart decisions. The increasing privacy concern promotes users to perturb or encrypt their private data before outsourcing, which poses significant challenges for truth discovery.

"The Sketch is a compact data structure useful for network measurements. However, to cope with the high speeds of the current data plane, it needs to be held in the small on-chip memory (SRAM). Therefore, the product of the counter size and the number of counters must be below a certain limit. With small counters, some will overflow. With large counters, the total number of counters will be small, but each counter will be shared by more flows, leading to poor accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a generic technique: <italic>self-adaptive counters (SEAD Counter)</italic>. When the value of the counter is small, it works as a standard counter. When the value of the counter is large however, we increment it using a predefined probability, so as to represent this large value. Moreover, in the SEAD Counter, the probability decreases when the value increases. We show that this technique can significantly improve the accuracy of counters. This technique can be adapted to different circumstances. We theoretically analyze the improvements achieved by the SEAD Counter. We further show that our SEAD Counter can be extended to three typical sketches and Bloom filters. We conduct extensive experiments on three real datasets and one synthetic dataset. The experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art, sketches using the SEAD Counter improve the accuracy by up to 13.6 times, while the Bloom filters using SEAD Counter can reduce the false positive rate by more than one order of magnitude.","[Xilai Liu, Yan Xu, Peng Liu, Tong Yang, Jiaqi Xu, Lun Wang]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, USA, China, China, U.K., USA]",15 February 2022,15,"[Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China, Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, Department of Computer and Science, Peking University, Beijing, China, Department of Computer and Science, Peking University, Beijing, China, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K., Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA]",February,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,Q1,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer and Science, Department of Computer and Science, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee69
"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been received extensive attentions. However, substantial CSR investment triggers some suppliers’ greenwashing behaviors which refer to hiding irresponsible operations and exaggerating CSR efforts, and raise concerns from consumers with CSR awareness. In this paper, we explore the impact of blockchain implementation on CSR efforts along a supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer under the supplier Stackelberg and retailer Stackelberg models. We consider a group of consumers with CSR awareness who have concerns about the supplier's greenwashing behavior. The adoption of blockchain helps the supply chain members foster consumers’ trust about CSR involvement, by linking CSR related information nodes to blockchain. We identify the conditions where blockchain implementation makes the supplier be more responsible. The supplier has stronger incentives to adopt blockchain when undertaking sufficiently high penalty after violation detection. Under the situation, the supplier makes more CSR efforts which is efficient in the presence of blockchain to eliminate consumers’ concerns about greenwashing. For the retailer, blockchain implementation is beneficial when the detection is efficient enough without blockchain and the penalty cost is not significantly high.","[ShuningYao*, YuanyiLiu*, XiutianShi*]",Control and Systems Engineering (Q3),"[China, China, China]",  2022,,"[School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing 210094, China, School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing 210094, China, School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing 210094, China]",,IFAC-PapersOnLine,Q3,IFAC-PapersOnLine,,"[School of Economics and Management, School of Economics and Management, School of Economics and Management]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee6a

"This study is concerned with the development of the axiomatic design (AD) method under an interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) environment and its application in evaluating blockchain deployment projects in supply chains. Blockchain is a transformative technology that has received significant attention recently. Blockchain technology can process various business transactions by offering a reliable and decentralized infrastructure. Supply chain management is an important application area of blockchains due to its desirable properties, including data security, extended visibility, product traceability, digitalization, and disintermediation. Since blockchain technologies are in their infancy, adopting them to supply chains requires proper design methodologies. Fuzzy AD offers valuable computational mechanisms to evaluate design options in the presence of functional requirements. However, extending AD to different fuzzy extensions is not an easy task, and area-based calculations hinder its widespread applicability. In this study, an IT2F-AD method is developed based on the concept of fuzzy subsethood. The potential of the fuzzy subsethood measure as the main computation engine within type-1 and IT2F-AD is demonstrated. Finally, an integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed by using IT2F Best-Worst Method (IT2F-BWM) and IT2F-AD.

"Blockchains are commonly used for crypto-currency systems, where they publicly store transactions. In a permissioned blockchain, only a few participants (nodes) can push new transactions to the chain. The known boundary on the number of faulty participants – up to f for 3f+1 participants – may be surpassed, causing the underlying consensus algorithm (BFT) to fail. When a malicious adversary compromises or corrupts enough nodes it may lead to the complete corruption of the ledger and even to the destruction of ledger copies the nodes hold. We suggest a reconstruction solution for the blockchain in the event of such an attack. We present a technique using verifiable secret sharing (VSS), making our solution immediate, requires no trust between the different blockchain parties, and provides each user an independent reconstruction. Our solution enables the exposure of an end-user's private key in case of dishonest reconstruction, thus, removing the incentive of such an act.","[ShlomiDolev, MatanLiber]",Computational Theory and Mathematics (Q2); Computer Science Applications (Q2); Information Systems (Q2); Theoretical Computer Science (Q3),[], May 2022,,[],May,Information and Computation,Q2,Information and Computation,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee78
"As the complexity of emergencies continues to increase, responding to them often exceeds the capabilities of any single public agency, multi-agent collaborative participation is an inevitable tendency in the development of emergency management. In the collaborative emergency response, it is important to support various responders with a unified platform to assist in decision-making, distribution of resources, and coordination of emergency operation. In recent years, blockchain has provided strong support for the innovation of emergency management mechanisms with its technical advantages such as distributed storage, decentralization, consensus algorithms, tamper-proof, traceability, and smart contract. This study firstly reviews the development of blockchain and its application in emergency management. Secondly, the connotation and key dilemmas of the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism are expounded from two aspects of the multi-agent participation and the construction of a collaborative mechanism. Then, the possibility of using blockchain to facilitate the innovation of multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism is analyzed from the aspects of emergency management information sharing, resource storage and distribution, the rights and obligations of multiple subjects, supervision, reward and punishment. Finally, a conceptual model of a multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism based on alliance chain and public chain is proposed. The application of blockchain provides a new perspective and motivation for the innovation of emergency management system. This study provides a new method for improving the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism, and is an important supplement and innovation to existing emergency management studies.","[CaijunZhanga, KaiqiangXianb, QianjunWuc, HuafeiYangc, JiayiLanga, XiaolongWangc]",Geology (Q1); Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology (Q1); Safety Research (Q1),[],1 April 2022,1,[],April,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,Q1,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee79

"Increasingly, the apparel industry generates enormous waste and pollution causing extreme water scarcity in emerging economies, where circular economy (CE) adoption can help to alleviate these pressing issues of this century. Environmentally conscious consumers gradually switch to purchasing secondhand clothes, prompting apparel companies to reposition their brands on sustainability dimensions. Nevertheless, buying secondhand apparel comes with a risk of counterfeiting and authenticity of the products. Blockchain can be an effective technology for tracking and tracing the products to their origin if effectively implemented in the apparel industry. In this study, we identify and analyze the antecedents to Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platform (BEEP) adoption in secondhand apparel retailing. We conducted a survey of Indian female consumers using the theoretical constructs of consumer’s buying motives and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results show that buying motives (namely economic motives, hedonic motives and critical motives) and UTAUT constructs (viz. performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) explain BEEP acceptance for secondhand apparel shopping. Risk of contamination increases BEEP adoption intention and also mediates the relationship between fashion motives and intention. Blockchain technology promotes behavioral intention towards online second-hand fashion clothing shopping, and by so doing reduces waste and promotes CE.","[GuruprakashJayabalasamy, SrinivasKoppu]",Marketing (Q1),[], October 2022,,[],October,Journal of Business Research,Q1,Journal of Business Research,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee83

"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been produced on a large scale since 2020. However, large-scale vaccine production has led to two forms of waste; namely, overproduction and underutilization. Most of today’s systems and technologies used to manage waste data related to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of providing transparency, traceability, accountability, trust, and security features. In this paper, we address the problem of COVID-19 vaccines waste due to their overproduction and underutilization. We propose a blockchain-based solution that is composed of five phases: registration, commitment; production and delivery; consumption; and waste assessment. These phases make up the complete life cycle of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are governed by several smart contracts to ensure accountability of all the actions taken by the involved entities and reduce any excessive waste caused by overproduction, overordering, or underconsumption. We ensure security, traceability, and data provenance by recording all actions through smart contracts in the form of events on an immutable ledger. We utilize decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the costs posed by large-sized file storage when stored on-chain. We present algorithms that describe the logic behind our developed smart contracts. We test and validate the functionalities of our proposed solution. We conduct security, cost, and scalability analyses to show that our solution is affordable, scalable, and secure. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain-based solutions to show its novelty and superiority.

"Blockchain technology can improve supply chain transparency to solve many problems in agricultural supply chains, such as lack of social responsibility and poor environmental performance. However, how to enable the transparency and sustainability of supply chain through blockchain technology is indeed a complex decision-making problem. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, this paper develops a hierarchical enablers framework for improving sustainable supply chain transparency (SSCT) by blockchain technology in the cocoa industry. Then, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to evaluate the weights of main enablers and sub-enablers by a real case of cocoa supply chain in an emerging African economy. The case results indicate the most important main enabler is “Technical Characteristics”, and the top three sub-enablers are: “blockchain smart contract”, “blockchain security,” and “tracking product components”, respectively. The framework and method of this study can help decision-makers and supply chain managers develop strategies to promote the effective application of blockchain to improve SSCT.

"Sustainability in cross-border logistics requires issues such as fragmented management to be addressed. Particular challenges arise in cross-border logistics in modular construction (CLMC) because supervision is inefficient, primarily due to continued use of paper-based documentation. Researchers have developed digital platforms that integrate accurate prefabricated module location information but their centralized operation creates information security issues such as tampering. Blockchain technology can overcome this limitation but relies on user participation. This study, therefore, develops a blockchain-based supervision (BBS) model with incentives for application in CLMC. The BBS model is developed using a design science research approach to enhance supervision of CLMC and motivate users to share data promptly, and then a prototype system is developed and evaluated in a CLMC case. The results show that the system brings a positive change in product accountability (df = 8, t = 0.6601, p = 0.528) compared with current paper-based recording process (df = 8, t = 0.0035, p = 0.997), and a positive change in data traceability (df = 8, t = 1.468, p = 0.180) compared with existing process (df = 8, t = 0.042, p = 0.967). In addition, this study obtains higher scores (552) than others in evaluating the incentive mechanisms. The security analysis is also discussed through data immutability, non-repudiation, authentication, and authorization. The ﬁndings of this study pave the way for a tamper-proof, incentive-enabled supervision mechanism in modular construction.","[LodovicaMarchesi, MicheleMarchesi, RobertoTonelli, Maria IlariaLunesu]","Environmental Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering (Q1); Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment (Q1); Strategy and Management (Q1)",[],15 November 2022,15,[],November,Journal of Cleaner Production,Q1,Journal of Cleaner Production,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee8b

This article provides a vision of the opportunities and challenges of adopting blockchain in ITS from the “data transparency” and “privacy” perspective. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1) Considering the amount of personal data collected by the CAVs, such as location, how would the integration of blockchain technology affect transparency, fairness, and lawfulness of personal data processing concerning the data subjects (as this is one of the main principles in the existing data protection regulations)? (2) How can the trade-off between transparency and privacy be addressed in blockchain-based ITS use cases?","[Tooska Dargahi, Hossein Ahmadvand, Mansour Naser Alraja, Chia-Mu Yu]",Information Systems (Q2); Information Systems and Management (Q2),"[UK, Iran, Sultanate of Oman, Taiwan]",11 December 2021,11,"[University of Salford, Salford, UK, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, Dhofar University, Salalah, Sultanate of Oman, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan]",December,Journal of Data and Information Quality,Q2,Journal of Data and Information Quality,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Salford, Sharif University of Technology, Dhofar University, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee91

Unfortunately, only a few datasets are publicly available for research in health insurance domain, yet none reports any negative claims. However, negative claims are essential not only to develop new machine learning approaches but also to test and validate automated artificial intelligence systems deployed by insurance providers.

"This paper explores and demonstrates the innovation potential of blockchain and smart contracts for supply chain finance (SCF) based on cross-border beef supply chains from Australia to China. Our study adopts mechanism design and design-driven activities, and specifically employs the Agents Events Data (AED) process mapping method, which is a hybrid approach that combines Business Process Redesign (BPR) and the Resources Events Assets (REA) accounting model. The AED method consists of three sequential stages: (1) map supply chain's present state or condition; (2) introduce blockchain and smart contracts to improve supply chain processes and “traditional” SCF models; and (3) evaluate the technology and innovation impact and create new models for SCF innovation. This study identified examples of how financial risks can be mitigated or reduced with blockchain and smart contracts; and, where the credit financing itself could be fundamentally transformed. Based on this analysis, the paper's contribution is twofold: First, it proposes the group buying business model as a basis of whole-of-supply-chain finance promising new areas for SCF models that can reduce financial cost and improve cash flow performance due to greater buyer-led financing certainty and the direct involvement of buy-side demand for supply-side improvements. Second, the study demonstrates the utility of the AED process mapping as a holistic framework with fine granular levels for future empirical and fieldwork and opens up new avenues for research.","[Tsung-TingKuo, AnhPham]",Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering (Q1); Information Systems and Management (Q1),[], November 2022,,[],November,Journal of Industrial Information Integration,Q1,Journal of Industrial Information Integration,Full length article,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee97

"Edge computing can serve latency-sensitive data generated by smart IoT devices in smart cities, which cannot be accommodated by cloud services. However, edge-enabled smart cities applications face many security issues such as massive centralization, vulnerability to tampering, and tracing difficulty. Blockchain, as an emerging ledger technology, can be a useful solution to these problems. However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.","[JunjieHuanga, LiangTanab, WenjuanLicd, KepingYue]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)","[China, China, China, Japan]", September 2021,,"[College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China, College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, China, Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan]",September,Journal of Information Security and Applications,Q1,Journal of Information Security and Applications,,"[College of Computer Science, College of Computer Science, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Global Information and Telecommunication Institute]",Sciences Directes,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ee9a
"Nowadays, the demand of storage and computational resources is increasing. As a result, the number of organisations and individuals that outsource their data to cloud is also increasing. Since data privacy and security are the main concerns, the users always encrypt their data before uploading the data to the cloud server. However, it obstructs the search operation which is one of the basic data utilisation. Search operation can be seen as one of the most important function in daily life as people frequently search for data they wanted. When the uploaded data is encrypted, the capability of a server to search for certain keyword is limited as it is not able to carry out a plaintext keyword search on encrypted data. In order to realise the privacy needs, a cryptographic primitive called searchable encryption that allows the search of keyword over the uploaded data that is encrypted is introduced. The concept of searchable encryption has been presented to enable data users to search for certain keyword over the encrypted data without leaking any information to the cloud server. However, most of the conventional searchable encryption schemes do not offer features that satisfy the real-world application such as fair payment, verifiability of search result, etc. While blockchain is well-known with its features such as decentralised, integrity, and immutability, thus blockchain-enabled searchable encryption schemes will be discussed on how it can be used to overcome or complement the downsides of conventional searchable encryption. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of blockchain-enabled searchable encryption schemes will be reviewed and compared.","[Haw-BinHow, Swee-HuayHeng]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)",[], June 2022,,[],June,Journal of Information Security and Applications,Q1,Journal of Information Security and Applications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee9b
"No doubt that medical data sharing is very crucial but important in realizing cross-hospital diagnosis and improving research development. In traditional mechanisms, there always exists a tradeoff between correctness of medical data and patient privacy. Here we are going to introduce the concept of blockchain and smart contract to build up an electronic medical record sharing mechanism: medical blockchain. Specifically, we have implemented the medical record sharing through cryptography design. Simulations have demonstrated that the correctness of medical data and privacy of patient can be guaranteed through the adoption of blockchain, while the integrity of a specific patient can be achieved via the smart contract control. Furthermore, the proposed medical blockchain can resist the potential Internet attack simulated by the formal verification. Thus, no leakage of patient identity occurs, and the tradeoff could be eliminated effectively without the modification of current hospital devices according to the simulation results.","[Jung-SanLee, Chit-JieChew, Jo-YunLiu, Ying-ChinChen, Kuo-YuTsai]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)",[], March 2022,,[],March,Journal of Information Security and Applications,Q1,Journal of Information Security and Applications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee9c
"Non-profit organization raise charity donation through different sources, and raised funds often require a clean traceability. Recently, fake charity fundraisers schemes have raised a social concern, and thus a trusted and auditable approach is necessary to manage charity organizations reputations. Blockchain-based charity (BBC) schemes are proposed with decentralization that ensure trust, transparency, and chronology among donators and beneficiaries. However, the schemes suffer from the high-end complexity of certificate generation. Motivated from this, in this paper, we propose a BBC scheme, UpHaaR, where donators, defined as charity persons (CP), and beneficiaries, defined as charity beneficiaries (CB), register in blockchain, managed for diverse fundraisers by charity organizations (CO). The scheme mitigates fake fundraisers, as the charity scheme data and fund allocations to CP are managed as ledger entries in the blockchain. To maintain the security and privacy of massive CP and CB users, the scheme proposes partial key generations through certificate-less cryptography (CLC), which mitigates expensive digital signing and eliminates certificate generation through key distribution centers. For signature aspects, the scheme proposes a lightweight certificate-less signcryption scheme (CSS) that eliminates collusion against insider attacks and reduces computational costs. The scheme is evaluated for security analysis using automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and informal attack analysis, and cost evaluations. The proposed results indicate the scheme’s viability against similar conventional approaches.","[DeeptiSaraswata, FarnazbanuPatelb, PronayaBhattacharyaa, AshwinVermaa, SudeepTanwara, RaviSharmac]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)",[], August 2022,,[],August,Journal of Information Security and Applications,Q1,Journal of Information Security and Applications,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee9d
"Smart contract execution requires the triggering condition. Triggering condition of smart contract is the information outside the blockchain, and thus an oracle is required to provide the data services. For the security of user funds in on-chain aggregation model, each oracle must pay the gas fees to transmit off-chain data to the blockchain and trigger the smart contract, but this way easily causes the network congestion. In view of this, we propose an elliptic curve threshold signature scheme for blockchain (BC-ECTSS) to overcome the above issue. In the random oracle (RO) model, we detailedly show BC-ECTSS satisfies the existential unforgeability against the adaptive chosen-message attacks; in addition, it has the anonymity and its computation cost is relatively low.","[HuifangYu, HanWang]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)","[China, China]", November 2022,,"[School of Cyberspace Security, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China, School of Cyberspace Security, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China]",November,Journal of Information Security and Applications,Q1,Journal of Information Security and Applications,,"[School of Cyberspace Security, School of Cyberspace Security]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ee9e

"Rational miners in the blockchain may admit the validity of search results directly to conserve calculation overhead without executing the validation. Such phenomenon is known as the Verifier's Dilemma that the search results of the blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme would be claimed to have been verified but devoid of valid verification. Besides, the top-k query technique utilized by most existing searchable encryption schemes fails to filter the search results from the user demands during retrieval, which results in massive ineffective access lists with high complexity. Aiming at the two problems, we present a blockchain-based multi-keyword ranked searchable encryption scheme and design a fair payment protocol for multi-user scenarios. Our scheme may achieve public verifiability and user fairness by leveraging the TrueBit network, while the data owner (DO) can withdraw search privileges from the authorized data user (DU). Also, we extend the searchable encryption scheme based on inverted index to multi-DO/multi-DU scenarios, and the HashMap index is used to diminish the response time and space complexity. Moreover, the proposed scheme supports the update of index keywords and files dynamically. To enhance retrieval accuracy, we modify the information divergence algorithm in machine learning and utilize the monotonically weighted aggregation function, which improves retrieval accuracy to around 97%. Finally, Security analysis illustrates correctness and resilience against typical attacks to verify the robustness and utility of the proposed scheme.","[XixiYana, SuweiFengb, YongliTangc, PeiYinb, DazhiDengd]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)","[454000, 454000, 454000, 454000, 454000]", December 2022,,"[Associate Professor of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory, School of Software, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China, 454000, Graduate student of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory of Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China, 454000, Professor of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory, School of Software, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China, 454000, Graduate student of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory of Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China, 454000, Chairman of Jiaozuo Wisdom Financial Services Co, Jiaozuo, China, 454000]",December,Journal of Information Security and Applications,Q1,Journal of Information Security and Applications,,"[Associate Professor of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory, Graduate student of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory of Henan Polytechnic University, Professor of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory, Graduate student of Network Information Security and Cryptography Laboratory of Henan Polytechnic University, Chairman of Jiaozuo Wisdom Financial Services Co]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eea0
"This paper proposes a blockchain-based secure and reliable data sharing scheme for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It aims to secure data sharing among AVs. We integrate the fifth-generation (5G) communication network with the proposed blockchain-based scheme to enable ultra-low latency, high reliability, and availability. We have incorporated the edge intelligence nodes (EINs) with blockchain for efficient data processing. We have used a random forest classifier model (RFCM) on the road accidents dataset to predict the accident severity, i.e., fatal, serious, and slight. It is based on road type, light condition, and vehicle movement to be shared among other AVs. We have considered various scenarios and performed the predictive analysis that needs to be secured by using blockchain technology. Results of the study demonstrate the accuracy of RFCM as 93%, the precision of 98%, 97%, and 87% for fatal, serious, and slight categories of accident severity, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme with RFCM yields better accuracy of 93% than other existing classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The blockchain-based proposed system has been compared with the traditional approach based on parameters such as network latency, scalability, computation time, delay comparison for node validation, data storage latency, and data storage cost. Obtained results show that the proposed scheme enables the data sharing reliable, secure, and efficient for AVs and outperforms the blockchain and non-blockchain systems in terms of security and efficiency.","[RiyaKakkara, RajeshGuptaa, SmitaAgrawala, SudeepTanwara, RaviSharmab]","Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)","[India, India, India, India, India]", June 2022,,"[Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Institute of Technology, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Institute of Technology, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Institute of Technology, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Institute of Technology, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, Centre for Inter-Disciplinary Research and Innovation, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, P.O.

"Bitcoin is the largest blockchain, and provides the underlying UTXO architecture used by many other cryptocurrencies. We identify an inherent bias embedded in this architecture (the Notebreaker mechanism) which forces users to ‘spend’ the entire content of a wallet address in order to make a payment, receiving ‘change’ into a unique new address. This inflates both the apparent volume transacted and network users, as well as minimizing the apparent fees of transacting. We develop an innovative Transaction Identification Methodology (TIM) to quantify the economic value of transactions from raw blockchain data. Using four different algorithms across three stages, we achieve 95% accuracy in quantifying the degree of bias in these measures. Validated across more than 430 million Bitcoin transactions involving 600 million wallet addresses, our methodology reveals that the Notebreaker mechanism inflates transaction volumes 8 times, makes the actual costs of blockchain transactions appear 3–7 times more expensive than what is commonly reported, and inflates wallet counts – a common heuristic of unique adopter counts.

"Preserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organization’s internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.","[Aisha ZahidJunejoa, Manzoor AhmedHashmania, Abdullah AbdulrehmanAlabdulatifb, Mehak MaqboolMemona, Syeda RabeeaJaffaria, M.

"With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications, a large amount of data is generated regularly. If this information is used by malicious attackers, it will be a great disaster for the relevant users. In this regard, this article focuses on the user’s identity privacy issues involved in the IoT. By protecting the user’s identity privacy, the attacker cannot associate the obtained data with the user’s real identity, and so achieve the purpose of protecting the user. This article uses the features of blockchain that cannot be tampered with nor forged to strengthen the reliability of the system. The proposed scheme saves the transaction information of user information through the Hyperledger and uses the ring signature method to obscure the real identity. A key generator is used to generate system public parameters and ring membership information required for signature. Users can use this information to hide their identity in a ring group of n users so that other users can only guess the true identity of the user with a probability of 1/n. Additionally, the method of aggregated signature is used to shorten the time and space required for k signature verification to 1/k, which greatly improves the efficiency. Finally, this article also uses an accountability mechanism to punish some attackers who attempt to waste system resources by revealing the real identity of the attacker and refusing to serve him. In this paper, GO language is used to write chain code to realize the proposed algorithm, and a prototype system is built through HyperLeger Fabric blockchain network, and the prototype system is verified by experiment. The correctness and efficiency of the above scheme are also proved through theoretical analysis and experiments.","[LiuYanhuiab, ZhangJianbiaoab, MuhammadSalman Pathanc, YuanYijiana, ZhangPuzhed, SarahMaroce, AvishekNagf]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[China, China, Ireland, China, China, Algeria, Ireland]", November 2022,,"[Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China, Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China, Department of Computer Science, Maynooth University, Ireland, Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China, Beijing-Dublin International College, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China, Department of Computer Science, Oran University of Sciences and Technology, Algeria, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Leinster, Dublin, Ireland]",November,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,Q1,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,"[Faculty of Information Technology, Faculty of Information Technology, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing-Dublin International College, Department of Computer Science, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eea5
"“Blockchain” is a buzzword that has captured attention from researchers in almost every possible domain. In a blockchain ecosystem, multiple parties across the network have to establish trust in an untrusted environment to ensure seamless nonrepudiation. Nonrepudiation is a crucial factor for secure information auditing in the blockchain. To achieve this, we require an optimal digital signature. In this work, we design a digital signature to address the nonrepudiation challenge in blockchain ecosystems. Our approach developed in the current work completed signing and verification tasks with 10% and 13% shorter processing times, respectively than the conventional digital signature scheme. The adoption of the high-performance Edwards curve aggregate signature (HECAS) in a blockchain ecosystem can yield a 10% improvement in the transaction flow, a 10% improvement in block validation and a 40% decrease in storage costs relative to the same system implemented without HECAS. Finally, we simulated various blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems and experimented with our scheme. The results show that our work can produce convincing, consistent results across various sensor data types from smart IoT-based blockchain solutions.","[GuruprakashJayabalasamy, SrinivasKoppu]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[India, India]", November 2022,,"[School of Information Technology and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India, School of Information Technology and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India]",November,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,Q1,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,"[School of Information Technology and Engineering, School of Information Technology and Engineering]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eea6
"With the rapid development of edge computing technologies, smart healthcare significantly improves people’s lives by collecting and analyzing health data in real time. However, security and privacy issues impede the wide deployment of smart healthcare systems (SHS). Most of existing solutions still have drawbacks with respect to computation efficiency and users’ privacy. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled attribute-based access control scheme with hidden policies is proposed for SHS. The scheme introduces multiple authorities to avoid single point failure. Especially, the mode of online-offline encryption relieves users’ online computation burden by transferring computation tasks to the idle time of users, and policy hiding protects users’ sensitive information. Furthermore, fair payments are realized based on blockchain and smart contracts to support the outsourcing of decryption between users and mobile edge computing servers. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and experimental results show that it is computationally efficient and hence can be used in the edge computing environment.","[YinghuiZhangabc, XuanniWeiac, JinCaod, JiantingNingbe, ZuobinYingf, DongZhengag]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),[], November 2022,,[],November,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,Q1,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eea7
"The rapid growth of modern technologies has encouraged non-profit organizations (NPOs) to harness such technologies to better serve the charity sector, especially in relation to charity donation processes. Non-profit organizations primarily rely on fundraising that may involve opaque operations, which leads to the exacerbation of fears that donations may be used for illegal purposes or not reach deserving people. The necessity of charity donations traceability system is inevitable to overcome such concerns, which have an adverse impact on doners’ trust in the donation process. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based donation traceability framework intended to enable all involved parties to trace the progress of charity donations from the moment they are given by donors to the moment they reach the intended recipients. The system is built on a public-permissioned blockchain on the Ethereum platform, with every transaction being recorded as a block in the chain. These blocks of information are immutable and visible to all parties, and they also enable timely and traceable transactions. The proposed framework’s effectiveness is evaluated using a hybrid qualitative approach and proves to improve the traceability of charity donations overcoming the uncertainty associated with current systems.","[AbeerAlmaghrabi, AreejAlhogail]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia]", November 2022,,"[Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia]",November,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,Q1,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,"[Department of Information Systems, Department of Information Systems]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eea8

"In recent years, blockchain holds promise to impact a wide range of application areas, but it still suffers from technical challenges such as security and scalability. The increase in the number of transactions puts blockchains under data storage pressure. The emergence of cross-chain technologies connects different blockchains and relieves the data storage pressure. However, the existing research generally focuses on the technical realization of cross chain, lacking in-depth research on consistency issues like data integrity verification of cross-chain interaction. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cross-chain data integrity verification scheme (DCIV) from the point of view of governing the chain by chain. We adopt supervision chain to audit the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction. We preprocess the off-chain original data in the form of Merkle tree. Before cross-chain interaction, we process the data with KZG polynomial commitment. During the auditing period, the supervision chain generates a challenge and verifies the integrity of cross-chain data. In particular, we add audit digests into the structure of transactions in blockchain to reduce the storage burden during auditing. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that DCIV can verify the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction, achieving secure and accurate cross-chain data sharing.","[JiajiaJianga, YushuZhanga, YouwenZhua, XuewenDongb, LiangminWangc, YongXiangd]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China, Australia]", November 2022,,"[College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi’an, China, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia]",November,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,Q1,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,"[College of Computer Science and Technology, College of Computer Science and Technology, College of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, School of Information Technology]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eeaa
"Preserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organization’s internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.","[Aisha ZahidJunejoa, Manzoor AhmedHashmania, Abdullah AbdulrehmanAlabdulatifb, Mehak MaqboolMemona, Syeda RabeeaJaffaria, M.

"The Internet of things technology has accelerated the development of e-health solutions and allows patients to obtain a more satisfying medical service experience. Each electronic health system(EHS) usually allows its subsystems to manage and access patient data to achieve its unique objective. Due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of the terminal, it is difficult to protect large amounts of patients’ medical record data in EHS. Medical data are a meaningful medical history resource, and are very important for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients. The privacy and integrity protection of medical data is a on-negotiable requirement for rational application in traditional medical systems. To achieve secure resource sharing and efficient service provision between users and medical service providers, we present a blockchain-based decentralized authentication and access control protocol for EHS that addresses broader medical data privacy and security needs. A practical Byzantine fault-tolerant(PBFT) negotiation mechanism based on multi-weighted subjective logic is adopted to improve the negotiation process.

"Data center (DC) interconnection allows us to have optical transmissions between DCs directly connected to optical networks, avoiding the use of a packet-based infrastructure. Thanks to the use of next-generation pluggable coherent optics, it is possible to create connectivity services (CSs) across multiple optical transport domains. In this multi-domain CS scenario, cloud operators and transport operators have to work together in the most dynamic way possible. To do so, they need a common place (i.e., a market) where the transport operators may expose their available optical resources and the cloud operators request (e.g., rent) them to be used in order to create end-to-end (E2E) CSs between DCs. Having multiple transport operators exposing their resource information in a common place requires a set of common rules (i.e., how much of the topology to show) to create E2E CSs requested between cloud operators. This paper makes use of the blockchain technology to present a blockchain-based extension for the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to allow each optical transport operator domain to become a peer in a blockchain network. In there, each peer follows the same rules and shares the same exact level of topology information by using a specific abstraction model to map the optical domain resources. This paper uses a set of three different abstraction models to validate their behavior on a blockchain system when managing multiple domain resources and the deployment of CSs across these domains.

"The cloud-aided sharing of e-healthcare data has great positive significance for research. However, due to the privacy consideration, these data are usually encrypted before uploading to the cloud server which impedes data sharing between different medical institutions. Conditional proxy re-encryption (CPRE) allows the proxy to converse ciphertext, especially by specifying a condition embed in the re-encryption key to achieve fine-grained access control over the ciphertext. Unfortunately, existing CPRE schemes cannot ensure the privacy of the condition, which may contain some sensitive private information. Furthermore, a malicious proxy server may return part of the results and even false data to save its computation or bandwidth. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based condition invisible proxy re-encryption scheme for the e-healthcare system. The proposed scheme guarantees the confidentiality of the data by hiding the condition in the re-encryption key so that the proxy cannot learn anything about the condition. Moreover, the ciphertext-searching algorithm is leveraged by executing the smart contract in the blockchain which ensures the results are correct and complete.

"Electronic auctions are becoming more and more popular in business activities, which provide the professionals with competitive prices for their products, pitching the suppliers directly against each other to allow suppliers to bid online against a published specification. In sealed-bid e-auctions, bidders send sealed-bid envelopes to auctioneer and auctioneer only can open them after a certain period of time to announce the highest bidder. In order to solve the issue of the opacity of whole sealed-bid auction process, researchers try to solve this problem by incorporating the blockchain technique into the e-auction systems with the properties of unforgeable transaction and public ledger of the blockchain. However, since the auctioneer might open the bid envelope before the deadline of the auction, it can tamper the bid price by colluding with malicious bidders for personal profit. In this paper, we propose a time-released blockchain-based sealed-bid e-auction scheme. We use time-lock encryption to ensure that the bidders’ bid data will not be available to anyone until a specified time, thus guaranteeing the security of the bidders’ data. At the same time, we use smart contracts for auction verification, which further improves the security of the scheme and avoids tampering by malicious auctioneers. In addition, we propose a secure sealed-bid e-auction scheme with fair arbitration (namely, SSBAS-FA), that is based on time-released blockchain to provide a fair arbitration mechanism in punishing malicious bidders. We give the deployment of a time-released blockchain that eliminates the demand of the trusted third party to perform the validation of the smart contract.

"With the continuous development of edge computing and IIoT technology, there are growing types of IIoT devices, and the number of such devices is continuously climbing. It is indispensable to authenticate devices in the IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose two blockchain-based authentication for IIoT devices with PUF. The first one relies on SRAM PUF, which is highly compatible with physical devices and has low cost. For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure.

"Internet of Things (IoT) has become more important for setting up a smart environment, e.g., smart home. It is a network of connected devices, which can provide many benefits such as automating and controlling the tasks on a daily basis without human intervention. While due to the dispersed structure, IoT networks are vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). To protect such environment, building a suitable collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN) is essential by enabling the exchange of required data among nodes. In addition, deploying a packet filtration mechanism with CIDN is necessary to reduce unwanted events and traffic. However, how to safeguard the integrity of exchanged information is a challenge, because a malicious internal node can manipulate and deliver untruthful data. Motivated by the blockchain technology, in this work, we develop a blockchain-based filtration mechanism with CIDN to help protect the security of IoT networks by refining unexpected events. In addition, we leverage IPFS technology to host and share information like blacklist. In the evaluation, we examine the filter performance with three real datasets, a simulated environment and a practical environment, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our filter compared with similar studies.","[WenjuanLiab, YuWanga, JinLia]",Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, China]", June 2022,,"[Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, China, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, China, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, China]",June,Journal of Systems Architecture,Q1,Journal of Systems Architecture,,"[Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eebb

"Runtime verification is a lightweight method for monitoring the formal specification of a system during its execution. It has recently been shown that a given state predicate can be monitored consistently by a set of crash-prone asynchronous distributed monitors observing the system, only if each monitor can emit verdicts taken from a large enough finite set. We revisit this impossibility result in the concrete context of linear-time logic (ltl) semantics for runtime verification, that is, when the correctness of the system is specified by an ltl formula on its execution traces. First, we show that monitors synthesized based on the 4-valued semantics of ltl (rv-ltl) may result in inconsistent distributed monitoring, even for some simple ltl formulas. More generally, given any ltl formula φ, we relate the number of different verdicts required by the monitors for consistently monitoring φ, with a specific structural characteristic of φ called its alternation number. Specifically, we show that, for every k ≥ 0, there is an ltl formula φ with alternation number k that cannot be verified at runtime by distributed monitors emitting verdicts from a set of cardinality smaller than k + 1. On the positive side, we define a family of logics, called distributed ltl (abbreviated as dltl), parameterized by k ≥ 0, which refines rv-ltl by incorporating 2k + 4 truth values. Our main contribution is to show that, for every k ≥ 0, every ltl formula φ with alternation number k can be consistently monitored by distributed monitors, each running an automaton based on a (2 ⌈ k/2 ⌉ +4)-valued logic taken from the dltl family.","[Borzoo Bonakdarpour, Pierre Fraigniaud, Sergio Rajsbaum, David Rosenblueth, Corentin Travers]",Artificial Intelligence (Q1); Control and Systems Engineering (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Information Systems (Q1); Software (Q1),"[U.S.A., France, México, México, France]",27 October 2022,27,"[Michigan State University, U.S.A., Université de Paris and CNRS, France, Universidad Nacional Autónomade México, México, Universidad Nacional Autónomade México, México, University of Bordeaux and CNRS, France]",October,Journal of the ACM,Q1,Journal of the ACM,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Michigan State University, Université de Paris and CNRS, Universidad Nacional Autónomade México, Universidad Nacional Autónomade México, University of Bordeaux and CNRS]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eebf

"Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people’s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.","[Enrico Daga, Luigi Asprino, Rossana Damiano, Marilena Daquino, Belen Diaz Agudo, Aldo Gangemi]",Conservation (Q1); Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design (Q2); Computer Science Applications (Q2); Information Systems (Q2),"[United Kingdom, Italy, Italy, Italy, Spain, Italy]",22 January 2022,22,"[The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, University of Turin (CIRMA and Dipartimento di Informatica), Turin, Italy, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, CNR, ISTC–Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, Rome, Italy]",January,Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage,Q1,Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[The Open University, University of Bologna, University of Turin (CIRMA and Dipartimento di Informatica), University of Bologna, Complutense University of Madrid, CNR]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eec1
"Blockchain is being used in various global supply chains with its ever-increasing maturity and popularity. However, in the presence of subjective information that does not have a digital footprint, blockchain application is a grey area. This is due to the difficulty in confirming the authenticity or legitimacy of information before achieving consensus on it using existing mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Authority (PoA) or Proof of Stake (PoS). In this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we propose the Proof by Earnestness (PoE) consensus mechanism that determines the subjective information’s truthfulness before further processing and formalising in blockchains.

"Recently, there has been significant growth in the consumption of the most widely diversified Internet of Things (IoT) technological knowledge, and devices, which has resulted in an impact on not only electrical items and the agricultural and food industries (Agri-Food) supply chain networks. This has sparked intense curiosity about the development of information sharing that is reliable, traceable, and transparent, and also increased significant research and advancement efforts. Existing IoT-based trace & authenticity methods for agri-food distribution networks are constructed on top of centralized architectures, which creates the potential for significant issues such as data security, manipulation, and standard points of weakness. A creative and scraping methodological approach to implementing decentralized trust-free networks is represented by blockchain technologies, the decentralized blockchain technologies that underpin cryptocurrencies. The fault tolerance, data integrity, visibility, and complete tracing of saved transactional data, along with cohesive digital information of property resources and independent transactions implementations, are in fact features built into this digitalization. This study introduces Agri-BlockIoT, a completely decentralized blockchain-based traceable platform for managing a global agro-food distribution network that can seamlessly connect IoT systems that produce and consume digital information all along the distribution chain.

"Smart city infrastructures such as transportation and energy networks are evolving into so-called cyber physical social systems (CPSSs), which collect and leverage citizens’ data in order to adapt services to citizens’ needs. The privacy implications of such systems are, however, significant and need to be addressed. Current systems either try to escape the privacy challenge via anonymization or use very rigid, hard-coded workflows that have been agreed with a data protection authority. In the case of the latter, there is a severe impact on data quality and richness, whereas in the former, only these hard-coded flows are permitted resulting in diminished functionality and potential. We address these limitations via user modeling in terms of investigating how to model and semantically represent user consent, preferences, and data usage policies that will guide the processing of said data in the data lake. Data protection is a horizontal field and consequently very wide. Therefore, we focus on a concrete setting where we extend the domain-agnostic SPECIAL policy language for a smart mobility use case supplied by Vienna’s largest utility provider. To that end, (1) we create an extension of SPECIAL in terms of a core CPSS vocabulary that lowers the semantic gap between the domain agnostic terms of SPECIAL and the vocabulary of the use case; (2) we propose a workflow that supports defining domain-specific vocabularies for complex CPSSs; and (3) show that these two contributions allow successfully achieving the goals of our setting.","[Javier D.

"In this information age, with the emergence of organizations, the number of various resources on the Internet of Things is also increasing. Generally, different users have different access permissions to different resources and most of the existing schemes have realized access control. But most of them are rough and not feasible in many organizations. Moreover, traditional access control schemes adopted a central entity or a trusted third party to centrally manage users’ permissions and access information, which can easily lead to single point of failure. Therefore, a kind of secure, trusted, and fine-grained access control is urgently needed in some large-scale organizations or institutions that maintain thousands of IoT devices. In order to solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based high-efficiency access control framework called BHE-AC to achieve secure and efficient access to resources for users. In BHE-AC, a registration model is designed to register users and resources, and it can evaluate the ability value for users according to their attributes which is an essential factor when requesting resources. Besides, we represent a blockchain-based token requesting mechanism to compare the capability values of users with requested resources; meanwhile, the mechanism also allows users to request multiple resources at the same time, which can avoid repeated requests. Then, an unforgeable token indicates the users’ access to a specific resource is granted to a requester only if a requester meets the access requirements; from then on, the user can use a token to invoke the resource. Finally, security analysis and experiments of our framework are given in our paper. The experimental results show that BHE-AC can achieve low cost and efficient access.","[Baobao Chai, Biwei Yan, Jiguo Yu, Guijuan Wang]",Library and Information Sciences (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Management Science and Operations Research (Q2),"[People’s Republic of China, People’s Republic of China, People’s Republic of China, People’s Republic of China]",08 April 2021,8,"[School of Computer Science and Technology, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), 250253, Jinan, Shandong, People’s Republic of China, School of Mathematical Sciences, Qufu Normal University, 273165, Qufu, Shandong, People’s Republic of China, School of Computer Science and Technology, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), 250253, Jinan, Shandong, People’s Republic of China, School of Computer Science and Technology, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), 250253, Jinan, Shandong, People’s Republic of China]",April,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,Q1,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Computer Science and Technology, School of Mathematical Sciences, School of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7eec6
"With the fast development of natural language processing (NLP), financial text data processing has gained much attention due to its huge potential business value. Deep learning model based on manual perception-based labeling is commonly used to illustrate implicit meanings behind financial text. However, such manual labeling is costly and subjective, and may not perform well due to its weak link with direct financial trading. This paper therefore proposes a novel learning model called Enhancement Learning (EL) on financial text data by using task-based labeling. Financial text often has its application task. The derived financial trading data from such task called task-based label is objective and links to certain characters of financial text. Compared to model trained only on manual labels, EL consists of two models trained by manual perception-based labels and derived task-based labels respectively. Then, the task-based model will be used as main model to produce initial judgment on text, with the perception-based model as a filter to drop cases which are different from common perception. This task-oriented perception-enhanced approach can improve the performance of financial text data due to its direct link with financial task and further verification from perception. This paper illustrates the proposed Enhancement Learning on financial text data by the case in stock return prediction. Numerical experiments show that EL performs better than both the perception-based model and the task-based model.","[Xiliu Man, Jianwu Lin]",Library and Information Sciences (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q2); Hardware and Architecture (Q2); Management Science and Operations Research (Q2),"[China, China]",02 January 2021,2,"[Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Tsinghua University, 518055, Shenzhen, China, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, 518055, Shenzhen, China]",January,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,Q1,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7eec7

The increase in security incidents caused by employees is evidence that providing information to raise employees’ awareness does not necessarily result in improving their security behaviour, and organisations must transform their security awareness program to extend beyond awareness to influence and behaviour change. This paper presents an in-depth case study of Telstra a leading Australian telecommunication company with a well-resourced and mature cybersecurity influence program that evolved as a result of experience throughout the years. The paper adopts the psychological attachment theory to explain strategies (e.g. cybersecurity champion) implemented by Telstra influence team to influence employees to improve their security-related behaviour. The contribution of this paper represents the first step for a comprehensive practice-based guidance for organisations on how to transform their cybersecurity beyond awareness to influence behavioural change.

"In this paper, we argue that off-balance-sheet information is potentially useful to evaluate accounting information quality in addition to financial indicators. We propose a novel method to evaluate the accounting information quality of listed companies in China by merging four financial attributes and six indicators derived from off-balance-sheet information, where the principal component analysis is used to filter the indicators which count heavily for the evaluation.

"With the commercialization of fifth generation mobile networks (5G) and continuous innovation of the Internet of Things (IoT), crowdsensing, as a new emerging IoT application, has further deepened our knowledge, utilizing various smart objects distributed throughout the whole industrial system for data collection and processing. To avoid a single point of failure and ensure data integrity, blockchain technology was widely applied. However, due to the demand for computing power and resources, IoT devices with limited capabilities and resources are unsuitable for crowdsensing implementation in the blockchain network. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based crowdsensing model named
with a novel consensus mechanism based on global reputation to resolve the issues raised above. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage scheme and two types of smart contracts to support the crowdsensing process automatically without the intervention of any third party. Finally, we implement a blockchain prototype on Hyperledger Sawtooth, extensive experimental results show that the proposed
outperforms other crowdsensing systems in terms of both scalability and security.","[JinwenXi, ShihongZou, GuoaiXu, YuemingLu]",Applied Mathematics (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q1); Computer Science Applications (Q1); Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1); Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Information Systems (Q1); Software (Q1),"[China, China, China, China]", August 2022,,"[School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China, School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China, School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China, School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China]",August,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,Q1,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,,"[School of Cyberspace Security, School of Cyberspace Security, School of Cyberspace Security, School of Cyberspace Security]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eecd

"Conventional Cooperative spectrum sensing techniques either suffer from single point of failure attack or lack in providing incentives to users which makes them incompatible for Wireless Service Provider (WSP). We propose a dynamic spectrum access framework for WSP which gives prominence to automated sensing and sharing with the use of blockchain. In this system, the opportunity of spectrum access is first examined by sensor nodes and the access right is then allocated to the users when their transactions to WSP are authenticated in a decentralized manner. Apart from using blockchain as a reliable platform for automatic enforcement of spectrum sensing, we propose a novel mechanism for securing our network from the threats designed primarily for Cognitive Radio Networks. In addition to this, our proposed approach enhances the scalability of blockchain networks by using the sidechains for storing data and checkpointing it onto main chain after periodic intervals of time. Extensive simulations in Octave indicate superior performance offered by our proposed model.","[AqsaAshraf Makhdomi, Gh.

More recently, crisis informatics has developed an analysis of these phenomena from social and computational perspectives. To further to assess the consequences and opportunities of technological developments in the field, we re-interpret the concept of informating, first developed by Zuboff to describe the impacts of technological changes on the workplace during the 1980s. We draw on four contemporary examples of how ICT is changing the way we conceive of and respond to natural hazards to offer a new reading of the concept of informating in the growing field of crisis informatics. We then argue that this concept suggests the adoption of a more critical agenda for crisis informatics research to better respond to contemporary challenges presented by climate change and natural hazards.","[Robert Soden, Leysia Palen]",Computer Networks and Communications; Human-Computer Interaction; Social Sciences (miscellaneous),"[USA, USA]",01 November 2018,1,"[University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,-,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Colorado, University of Colorado Boulder]",ACM,2018,63ae010034ac983172e7eed1

"Bitcoin is an innovative technological network, a new, non-governmental currency, and a worldwide group of users. In other words, Bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of risks and challenges for anyone using it. We investigated how everyday users of Bitcoin develop trust in Bitcoin on one of the largest online communities devoted to Bitcoin: the Reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in Bitcoin develops based on contributions to this community. On r/bitcoin, trust in Bitcoin is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the ""True Bitcoiner"" ideology. This ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation of Bitcoin as functionally ""trustless"" and risk-free. Despite widespread evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using Bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective. This ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing Bitcoin's technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting 'corrupt' social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating or 'HODLing' quantities of Bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal future. We conclude that this ""True Bitcoiner"" ideology is maintained despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows participants to more easily interpret Bitcoin and make decisions by reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. The role of this ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts.","[Megan Knittel, Shelby Pitts, Rick Wash]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2); Social Sciences (miscellaneous) (Q2),"[USA, USA, USA]",07 November 2019,7,"[Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,Q2,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Michigan State University, Michigan State University, Michigan State University]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7eed4
"Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the ""Ostrom Workshop."" A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a ""constitutional layer"" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.","[Seth Frey, P. M. Krafft, Brian C.

"Many applications such as smart metering and location based services pose strong privacy requirements but achieving privacy protection at the client side is a non-trial problem as payment for the services must be computed by the server at the end of each billing period. In this paper, we propose a privacy preservation and billing scheme termed PPDIR based on delayed information release. PPDIR relies on a novel group signature mechanism and the asymmetric Rabin cryptosystem to protect the privacy of the clients and their requests, to achieve accountability and non-repudiation, and to shift the computational complexity to the server side. It adopts a secret token for anonymity and the token is updated for each client at the beginning of each billing period and securely released only to the server at the end of the billing period. Such a strategy can prevent the server from linking a client&#x2019;s requests made at different billing periods. It also prevents any adversary from linking any request to any client. Note that the server is able to figure out all requests made by a client within a billing period after receiving the delayed token, which is unavoidable for billing purpose. We prove the security properties of the group signature scheme, and analyze the security strength of PPDIR. Our study indicates that PPDIR can achieve privacy-preservation, confidentiality, non-repudiation, accountability, and other security objectives. We also evaluate the performance of our scheme in terms of communication and computational overheads.","[Cayley MacArthur, Caroline Wong, Mark Hancock]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2); Social Sciences (miscellaneous) (Q2),"[Canada, Canada, Canada]",07 November 2019,7,"[University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,Q2,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7eed6

In this paper we use mixed methods, including digital trace ethnography, to look beyond a single social media platform to the broader information ecosystem. We aim to understand how multiple social media platforms are used, in parallel and complementary ways, to achieve the strategic goals of online information operations. We focus on a specific case study: the contested online conversation surrounding Syria Civil Defense (the White Helmets), a group of first responders that assists civilians affected by the civil war within the country. Our findings reveal a network of social media platforms from which content is produced, stored, and integrated into the Twitter conversation. We highlight specific activities that sustain the strategic narratives and attempt to influence the media agenda. And we note that underpinning these efforts is the work of resilience-building: the use of alternative (non-mainstream) platforms to counter perceived threats of 'censorship' by large, established social media platforms.

Better ways of defining and measuring these expressions may therefore be useful both in understanding how social identity is expressed in text, and how the self is presented on Twitter. To this end, the present work makes three contributions. First, using qualitative methods, we identify and define the concept of a personal identifier, which is more representative of the ways in which identity is signaled in Twitter bios. Second, we propose a method to extract all personal identifiers expressed in a given bio. Finally, we present a series of validation analyses that explore the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.

"The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons.

Of particular relevance in this context are arithmetic overflow bugs, as integers are often used to represent financial assets like account balances. Motivated by this observation, this paper presents SolType, a refinement type system for Solidity that can be used to prevent arithmetic over- and under-flows in smart contracts. SolType allows developers to add refinement type annotations and uses them to prove that arithmetic operations do not lead to over- and under-flows. SolType incorporates a rich vocabulary of refinement terms that allow expressing relationships between integer values and aggregate properties of complex data structures. Furthermore, our implementation, called Solid, incorporates a type inference engine and can automatically infer useful type annotations, including non-trivial contract invariants.","[Yasaman Rohanifar, Sharifa Sultana, Shaid Hasan, Priyank Chandra]",Social Sciences (miscellaneous) (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[Canada, USA, Bangladesh, Canada]",11 November 2022,11,"[University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, BUET, Dhaka, Bangladesh, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,Q1,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Toronto, Cornell University, BUET, University of Toronto]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eedf
"Separating and recycling waste is an important topic to protect our environment and achieve a more sustainable future. However, recycling also is a complex process, as each type of waste needs a specific recycling method. This comes along with multiple recycling containers, each relevant for one specific type of waste. Ensuring a correct recycling process therefore not only requires specific infrastructure, but also a respective attitude and knowledge of the population. Stressing the need for an accessible educational opportunity addressing waste separation, we present a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application that guides a user through a recycling process and hence scaffolds the learning of proper recycling of each type of waste. The app further provides a prototypical implementation of a product scanner, that identifies the waste type based on a marker and assists the recycling on a case-by-case decision. Using self-determination theory as a framework, we integrated gamification elements, aiming for enhanced need satisfaction, motivation and user experience. In a user study, we compared the gamified version to a control version, with both app versions yielding a high acceptance, user experience, and waste separation behavior. This indicates the importance of providing easy-to-use mobile apps allowing for a learning and assistance of proper recycling.","[Philipp Schaper, Anna Riedmann, Sebastian Oberdörfer, Maileen Krähe, Birgit Lugrin]",Social Sciences (miscellaneous) (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[Germany, Germany, Germany, Germany, Germany]",20 September 2022,20,"[University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany, Julius-Maximilians-University Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany]",September,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,Q1,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Würzburg, University of Würzburg, University of Würzburg, University of Würzburg, Julius-Maximilians-University Würzburg]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eee0

We discuss the themes of visibility and self-disclosure, unintentional information leakage and digital privacy literacies constructed from our analysis. We contribute insights not only into people's difficulties in recalling and conceptualising their digital traces but of subsequently envisioning how their online information may be combined, or (re)identified across their traces and address a current gap in research by showing that awareness is lacking around the potential for personal information to be correlated by and made coherent to/by others, posing risks to individuals, employers, and even the state. We touch on inequalities of privacy, freedom and legitimacy that exist for different groups with regard to what they make (or feel compelled to make) available online and we contribute to current methodological work on the use of sketching to support visual sense making in data narrative interviews. We conclude by discussing the need for interventions that support personal reflection on the potential visibility of combined digital traces to spotlight hidden vulnerabilities, and promote more proactive action about what is shared and not shared online.","[Emma Nicol, Jo Briggs, Wendy Moncur, Amal Htait]",Social Sciences (miscellaneous) (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[United Kingdom, United Kingdom, United Kingdom, United Kingdom]",11 November 2022,11,"[University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,Q1,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Strathclyde, Northumbria University, University of Strathclyde, Aston University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eee1
"One of the key emerging roles of the YouTube platform is providing creators the ability to generate revenue from their content and interactions. Alongside tools provided directly by the platform, such as revenue-sharing from advertising, creators co-opt the platform to use a variety of off-platform monetization opportunities. In this work, we focus on studying and characterizing these alternative monetization strategies. Leveraging a large longitudinal YouTube dataset of popular creators, we develop a taxonomy of alternative monetization strategies and a simple methodology to detect their usage automatically. We then proceed to characterize the adoption of these strategies. First, we find that the use of external monetization is expansive and increasingly prevalent, used in 18% of all videos, with 61% of channels using one such strategy at least once. Second, we show that the adoption of these strategies varies substantially among channels of different kinds and popularity, and that channels that establish these alternative revenue streams often become more productive on the platform. Lastly, we investigate how potentially problematic channels -- those that produce Alt-lite, Alt-right, and Manosphere content -- leverage alternative monetization strategies, finding that they employ a more diverse set of such strategies significantly more often than a carefully chosen comparison set of channels. This finding complicates YouTube's role as a gatekeeper, since the practice of excluding policy-violating content from its native on-platform monetization may not be effective. Overall, this work provides an important step toward broadening the understanding of the monetary incentives behind content creation on YouTube.","[Yiqing Hua, Manoel Horta Ribeiro, Thomas Ristenpart, Robert West, Mor Naaman]",Social Sciences (miscellaneous) (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[USA, Switzerland, USA, Switzerland, USA]",11 November 2022,11,"[Cornell Tech, New York, NY, USA, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, Cornell Tech, New York, NY, USA, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, Cornell Tech, New York, NY, USA]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,Q1,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Cornell Tech, EPFL, Cornell Tech, EPFL, Cornell Tech]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eee2
"Communication technologies have significant social impacts, and it is important to consider how designers' and developers' values shape their design. Increasingly, these technologies are released as continually evolving platforms and services, so their development involves ongoing discussions and debates about unforeseen problems and future directions. However, there is a gap in research about how designers, developers, and other stakeholders engage with values during later stages of development. We investigate discussions about values in the context of open source software development, focusing on projects related to the Decentralized Web. We conducted a large-scale analysis of GitHub issues among diverse yet ideologically-related projects. We show that the percentage of discussions about values increases later in development, and we identify features and outcomes of conflicts related to open source participants' values.

"Sexual exploration is a natural part of adolescent development; yet, unmediated internet access has enabled teens to engage in a wider variety of potentially riskier sexual interactions than previous generations, from normatively appropriate sexual interactions to sexually abusive situations. Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N=45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13--17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of ""safe"" versus ""risky"". Our work provides a deeper understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being, risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.","[Ashwaq Alsoubai, Jihye Song, Afsaneh Razi, Nurun Naher]",Social Sciences (miscellaneous) (Q1); Computer Networks and Communications (Q2); Human-Computer Interaction (Q2),"[USA, USA, USA, USA]",11 November 2022,11,"[Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,Q1,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Vanderbilt University, University of Central Florida, Drexel University, University of Central Florida]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eee4
"Air pollution is a serious global issue impacting public health and social economy. In particular, exposure to small particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) can cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancer. Fine-grained urban air quality monitoring is crucial yet difficult to achieve. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an ambient environment aware system, namely UbiAir, which can support fine-grained urban air quality monitoring through mobile crowdsensing on a bike-sharing system. We have built specific IoT box configured with multiple pollutant sensors and attached on shared bikes to sample micro-scale air quality data in the monitoring space that is split by a scalable grid structure. Both hardware and software data calibration methods are exploited in UbiAir to make the sampled data reliable. Then, we use Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) as an inference model that leverages the calibrated samples to recover data points without direct measurements and reconstruct an accurate air quality map covering the entire monitoring space. In addition, red envelope based incentive schemes and differential rewarding strategies have been designed in UbiAir, and an adaptive BCS algorithm is proposed to deploy the red envelopes at the most informative positions to facilitate data sampling and inference. We have tested our system on campus with over 100k data measurements collected by 36 students through 18 days. Our real-world experiments show that UbiAir is a light-weight, low-cost, accurate and scalable system for fine-grained air quality monitoring, as compared with other solutions.","[Di Wu, Tao Xiao, Xuewen Liao, Jie Luo, Chao Wu, Shigeng Zhang]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q3); Hardware and Architecture (Q4); Human-Computer Interaction (Q4),"[China, China, China, China, China, China]",15 June 2020,15,"[School of Design, Hunan University, China, Department of Computer Engineering, Hunan University, China, Department of Computer Engineering, Hunan University, China, Department of Computer Engineering, Hunan University, China, School of Public Affairs, Zhejiang University, China, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China]",June,"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",Q3,"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[School of Design, Department of Computer Engineering, Department of Computer Engineering, Department of Computer Engineering, School of Public Affairs, School of Computer Science and Engineering]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7eee5
"Recent years have witnessed a rapid proliferation of personalized mobile Apps, which poses a pressing need for user experience improvement. A promising solution is to model App usage by learning semantic-aware App usage representations which can capture the relation among time, locations and Apps. However, it is non-trivial due to the complexity, dynamics, and heterogeneity characteristics of App usage. To smooth over these obstacles and achieve the goal, we propose SA-GCN, a novel representation learning model to map Apps, location, and time units into dense embedding vectors considering spatio-temporal characteristics and unit properties simultaneously. To handle complexity and dynamics, we build an App usage graph by regarding App, time, and location units as nodes and their co-occurrence relations as edges. For heterogeneity, we develop a Graph Convolutional Network with meta path-based objective function to combine the structure of the graph and the attribute of units into the semantic-aware representations. We evaluate the performance of SA-GCN via a large-scale real-world dataset. In-depth analysis shows that SA-GCN characterizes the complex relationships among different units and recover meaningful spatio-temporal patterns. Moreover, we make use of the learned representations in App usage prediction task without post-training and achieve 8.3% of the performance gain compared with state-of-the-art baselines.","[Yue Yu, Tong Xia, Huandong Wang, Jie Feng, Yong Li]",Computer Networks and Communications (Q3); Hardware and Architecture (Q4); Human-Computer Interaction (Q4),"[China, China, China, China, China]",04 September 2020,4,"[Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China]",September,"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",Q3,"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7eee6

"Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time (I) between blocks for validating smart contracts present in transactions. In such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time (τ) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large τ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale τ/I ≈1 in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in parallel to ASIC mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to ζ blocks, where ζ is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay Δ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale τ without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling up of τ/I in existing blockchains","[Sourav Das, Nitin Awathare, Ling Ren, Vinay J.

"The prosperity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem drives the need for digital asset trading platforms. Beyond centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are introduced to allow users to trade cryptocurrency without transferring the custody of their digital assets to the middlemen, thus eliminating the security and privacy issues of traditional CEX. Uniswap, as the most prominent cryptocurrency DEX, is continuing to attract scammers, with fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take the first step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first collect all the transactions related to Uniswap V2 exchange and investigate the landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives. Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap based on a guilt-by-association heuristic and a machine-learning powered technique. We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on Uniswap, which suggests that roughly 50% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam tokens and liquidity pools are created specialized for the ""rug pull"" scams, and some scam tokens have embedded tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts. We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help carry out the scams in league with the scam token/pool creators. The scammers have gained a profit of at least $16 million from 39,762 potential victims. Our observations in this paper suggest the urgency to identify and stop scams in the decentralized finance ecosystem, and our approach can act as a whistleblower that identifies scam tokens at their early stages.","[Pengcheng Xia, Haoyu Wang, Bingyu Gao, Weihang Su, Zhou Yu, Xiapu Luo, Chao Zhang, Xusheng Xiao, Guoai Xu]","Computer Networks and Communications; Computer Science (miscellaneous); Hardware and Architecture; Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","[China, China, China, China, China, China, China, USA, China]",15 December 2021,15,"[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HongKong, China, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China]",December,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,-,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Tsinghua University, Case Western Reserve University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7eee9

"Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes, i.e., either based on the operation codes (opcodes) of the smart contract binaries or the transaction patterns of addresses. However, state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability and high false positive rates. Moreover, machine-learning based methods are susceptible to evasion techniques, and transaction-based techniques do not work on smart contracts that have a small number of transactions. These limitations render existing methods for detecting Ponzi schemes ineffective. In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, by strictly following the definition of Ponzi schemes, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to first generate the semantic information for each feasible path in smart contracts and then identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims. Our observations confirm the urgency of identifying and mitigating Ponzi schemes in the blockchain ecosystem.","[Weimin Chen, Xinran Li, Yuting Sui, Ningyu He, Haoyu Wang, Lei Wu, Xiapu Luo]","Computer Networks and Communications; Computer Science (miscellaneous); Hardware and Architecture; Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","[China, China, China, China, China, China, Hong Kong]",04 June 2021,4,"[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Peking University, Beijing, China, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, Zhejiang University, HangZhou, China, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong]",June,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,-,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Peking University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Zhejiang University, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7eeeb
"In this paper, we study a canonical distributed resource allocation problem arising in blockchains. While distributed resource allocation is a well-studied problem in networking, the blockchain setting additionally requires the solution to be resilient to adversarial behavior from a fraction of nodes. Scaling blockchain performance is a basic research topic; a plethora of solutions (under the umbrella of sharding ) have been proposed in recent years. Although the various sharding solutions share a common thread (they cryptographically stitch together multiple parallel chains), architectural differences lead to differing resource allocation problems. In this paper we make three main contributions: (a) we categorize the different sharding proposals under a common architectural framework, allowing for the emergence of a new, uniformly improved, uni-consensus sharding architecture. (b) We formulate and exactly solve a core resource allocation problem in the uni-consensus sharding architecture -- our solution, Free2shard, is adversary-resistant and achieves optimal throughput. The key technical contribution is a mathematical connection to the classical work of Blackwell approachability in dynamic game theory. (c) We implement the sharding architecture atop a full-stack blockchain in 3000 lines of code in Rust -- we achieve a throughput of more than 250,000 transactions per second with 6 shards, a vast improvement over state-of-the-art.","[Ranvir Rana, Sreeram Kannan, David Tse, Pramod Viswanath]","Computer Networks and Communications; Computer Science (miscellaneous); Hardware and Architecture; Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","[USA, USA, USA, USA]",28 February 2022,28,"[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA, University of Washington at Seattle, Seattle, WA, USA, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA]",February,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,-,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Washington at Seattle, Stanford University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eeec

"Residential Internet speeds have been rapidly increasing, reaching averages of ~100 Mbps in most developed countries. Several studies have shown that users have way more bandwidth than they need, only using about 20-30% on a regular day. Several systems exploit this trend by enabling users to monetize their spare bandwidth, e.g., by sharing their WiFi connection or by participating in distributed proxy or VPN (dVPN) services. Despite the proliferation of such systems, little is known on how such marketplaces operate, what are the key factors that determine the price of the spare bandwidth, and how such prices differ worldwide. In this work, we shed some light on this topic using dVPNs as a use-case. We start by formalizing the problem of bandwidth monetization as an optimization between a buyer's cost and seller's income. Next, we explore three popular dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, and Tachyon) using both active and passive measurements. We find that dVPNs have a large and growing footprint, and offer comparable performance to their centralized counterpart. We identify Mysterium (in the US) as the most concrete realization of a bandwidth marketplace, for which we derive a value of spare Internet bandwidth ranging between 11 and 14 cents per GB. We also show that both buyers and sellers utilize ad-hoc ""rules-of-thumb"" when choosing their prices, which results in a sub-optimal marketplace. By applying our optimization, a seller's income can be tripled by setting a price lower than the default one which allows to attract more buyers. These observations motivate us to create RING, a first and concrete system which helps sellers to automatically adjust their prices and traffic volumes across multiple marketplaces.","[Yunming Xiao, Matteo Varvello, Aleksandar Kuzmanovic]","Computer Networks and Communications; Computer Science (miscellaneous); Hardware and Architecture; Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","[USA, USA, USA]",06 June 2022,6,"[Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA, Nokia Bell Labs, Holmdel, NJ, USA, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA]",June,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,-,Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Northwestern University, Nokia Bell Labs, Northwestern University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7eeee

"Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream languages, a gas limit restricts the execution of an Ethereum smart contract: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other interacting contracts) runs out of gas.

In particular, ownership, typestate, and assets, which Obsidian uses to provide safety guarantees, have not seen broad adoption together in popular languages and result in significant usability challenges. We performed an empirical study with 20 participants comparing Obsidian to Solidity, which is the language most commonly used for writing smart contracts today.

"Static analysis of smart contracts as-deployed on the Ethereum blockchain has received much recent attention. However, high-precision analyses currently face significant challenges when dealing with the Ethereum VM (EVM) execution model. A major such challenge is the modeling of low-level, transient “memory” (as opposed to persistent, on-blockchain “storage”) that smart contracts employ. Statically understanding the usage patterns of memory is non-trivial, due to the dynamic allocation nature of in-memory buffers. We offer an analysis that models EVM memory, recovering high-level concepts (e.g., arrays, buffers, call arguments) via deep modeling of the flow of values. Our analysis opens the door to Ethereum static analyses with drastically increased precision. One such analysis detects the extraction of ERC20 tokens by unauthorized users. For another practical vulnerability (redundant calls, possibly used as an attack vector), our memory modeling yields analysis precision of 89%, compared to 16% for a state-of-the-art tool without precise memory modeling. Additionally, precise memory modeling enables the static computation of a contract’s gas cost. This gas-cost analysis has recently been instrumental in the evaluation of the impact of the EIP-1884 repricing (in terms of gas costs) of EVM operations, leading to a reward and significant publicity from the Ethereum Foundation.","[Sifis Lagouvardos, Neville Grech, Ilias Tsatiris, Yannis Smaragdakis]","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q2); Software (Q3)","[Greece, Greece, Greece, Greece]",13 November 2020,13,"[University of Athens, Greece, University of Athens, Greece, University of Athens, Greece, University of Athens, Greece]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,Q2,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Athens, University of Athens, University of Athens, University of Athens]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7eef6

"Automation of fixpoint reasoning has been extensively studied for various mathematical structures, logical formalisms, and computational domains, resulting in specialized fixpoint provers for heaps, for streams, for term algebras, for temporal properties, for program correctness, and for many other formal systems and inductive and coinductive properties. However, in spite of great theoretical and practical interest, there is no unified framework for automated fixpoint reasoning. Although several attempts have been made, there is no evidence that such a unified framework is possible, or practical. In this paper, we propose a candidate based on matching logic, a formalism recently shown to theoretically unify the above mentioned formal systems. Unfortunately, the (Knaster-Tarski) proof rule of matching logic, which enables inductive reasoning, is not syntax-driven. Worse, it can be applied at any step during a proof, making automation seem hopeless. Inspired by recent advances in automation of inductive proofs in separation logic, we propose an alternative proof system for matching logic, which is amenable for automation. We then discuss our implementation of it, which although not superior to specialized state-of-the-art automated provers for specific domains, we believe brings some evidence and hope that a unified framework for automated reasoning is not out of reach.","[Xiaohong Chen, Minh-Thai Trinh, Nishant Rodrigues, Lucas Peña, Grigore Roşu]","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q2); Software (Q3)","[USA, Singapore, USA, USA, USA]",13 November 2020,13,"[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,Q2,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Advanced Digital Sciences Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7eef8
"Learning distributed representations of source code has been a challenging task for machine learning models. Earlier works treated programs as text so that natural language methods can be readily applied. Unfortunately, such approaches do not capitalize on the rich structural information possessed by source code. Of late, Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed to learn embeddings of programs from their graph representations. Due to the homogeneous (i.e. do not take advantage of the program-specific graph characteristics) and expensive (i.e. require heavy information exchange among nodes in the graph) message-passing procedure, GNN can suffer from precision issues, especially when dealing with programs rendered into large graphs. In this paper, we present a new graph neural architecture, called Graph Interval Neural Network (GINN), to tackle the weaknesses of the existing GNN. Unlike the standard GNN, GINN generalizes from a curated graph representation obtained through an abstraction method designed to aid models to learn. In particular, GINN focuses exclusively on intervals (generally manifested in looping construct) for mining the feature representation of a program, furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling the learning to large graphs.","[Yu Wang, Ke Wang, Fengjuan Gao, Linzhang Wang]","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q2); Software (Q3)","[China, USA, China, China]",13 November 2020,13,"[Nanjing University, China, Visa Research, USA, Nanjing University, China, Nanjing University, China]",November,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,Q2,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Nanjing University, Visa Research, Nanjing University, Nanjing University]",ACM,2020,63ae010034ac983172e7eef9

"Smart contracts are programs that execute in blockchains such as Ethereum to manipulate digital assets. Since bugs in smart contracts may lead to substantial financial losses, there is considerable interest in formally proving their correctness. However, the specification and verification of smart contracts faces challenges that rarely arise in other application domains. Smart contracts frequently interact with unverified, potentially adversarial outside code, which substantially weakens the assumptions that formal analyses can (soundly) make. Moreover, the core functionality of smart contracts is to manipulate and transfer resources; describing this functionality concisely requires dedicated specification support. Current reasoning techniques do not fully address these challenges, being restricted in their scope or expressiveness (in particular, in the presence of re-entrant calls), and offering limited means of expressing the resource transfers a contract performs.","[Christian Bräm, Marco Eilers, Peter Müller, Robin Sierra]","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)","[Switzerland, Switzerland, Switzerland, Switzerland]",15 October 2021,15,"[ETH Zurich, Switzerland, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, ETH Zurich, Switzerland]",October,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,Q1,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[ETH Zurich, ETH Zurich, ETH Zurich, ETH Zurich]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7eefb

This is unfortunate, as agreement-based distributed services such as data stores, locks, and ledgers are ubiquitous and potentially permit modular, scalable verification approaches that mimic their modular design. We address this need for verification of distributed agreement-based systems through our novel modeling and verification framework, QuickSilver, that is not only modular, but also fully automated. The key enabling feature of QuickSilver is our encoding of abstractions of verified agreement protocols that facilitates modular, decidable, and scalable automated verification.

"The Solidity programming language is the most widely used language for smart contract development. Improving smart contracts’ correctness, security, and performance has been the driving force for research in vulnerability detection, program analysis, and compiler techniques for Solidity. Similar to system-level languages such as C, Solidity enables the embedding of low-level code in programs, in the form of inline assembly code. Developers use inline assembly for low-level optimizations, extending the Solidity language through libraries, and using blockchain-specific opcodes only available through inline assembly. Nevertheless, inline assembly fragments are not well understood by an average developer and can introduce security threats as well as affect the optimizations that can be applied to programs by the compiler; it also significantly limits the effectiveness of source code static analyzers that operate on the Solidity level. A better understanding of how inline assembly is used in practice could in turn increase the performance, security, and support for inline assembly in Solidity. This paper presents a large-scale quantitative study of the use of inline assembly in 6.8M smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that 23% of the analyzed smart contracts contain inline assembly code, and that the use of inline assembly has become more widespread over time. We further performed a manual qualitative analysis for identifying usage patterns of inline assembly in Solidity smart contracts. Our findings are intended to help practitioners understand when they should use inline assembly and guide developers of Solidity tools in prioritizing which parts of inline assembly to implement first. Finally, the insights of this study could be used to enhance the Solidity language, improve the Solidity compiler, and to open up new research directions by driving future researchers to build appropriate methods and techniques for replacing inline assembly in Solidity programs when there is no real necessity to use it.","[Stefanos Chaliasos, Arthur Gervais, Benjamin Livshits]","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality (Q1); Software (Q1)","[UK, UK, UK]",31 October 2022,31,"[Imperial College London, UK, Imperial College London, UK, Imperial College London, UK]",October,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,Q1,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Imperial College London, Imperial College London, Imperial College London]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef00

Our approach provides a convenient DSL for expressing data type refactorings and employs program synthesis to generate the new version of the contract. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Solidare and demonstrate its capabilities on real-world smart contracts from Etherscan and GasStation.

"In this paper, we design and implement the first-ever decentralized replicated relational database with blockchain properties that we term blockchain relational database. We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.","[Senthil Nathan, Chander Govindarajan, Adarsh Saraf, Manish Sethi, Praveen Jayachandran]",Computer Science (miscellaneous),"[, , , , ]",01 July 2019,1,"[IBM Research - India, IBM Research - India, IBM Research - India, IBM Industry Platforms, IBM Research - India]",July,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,-,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[IBM Research - India, IBM Research - India, IBM Research - India, IBM Industry Platforms, IBM Research - India]",ACM,2019,63ae010034ac983172e7ef0a

"Despite recent intensive research, existing blockchain systems do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed applications. In particular, distributed applications collaborate with each other following service level agreements (SLAs) to provide different services. While collaboration between applications, e.g., cross-application transactions, should be visible to all applications, the internal data of each application, e.g, internal transactions, might be confidential. In this paper, we introduce CAPER, a permissioned blockchain system to support both internal and cross-application transactions of collaborating distributed applications. In CAPER, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each application accesses and maintains only its own view of the ledger including its internal and all cross-application transactions. CAPER also introduces three consensus protocols to globally order cross-application transactions between applications with different internal consensus protocols.

In this paper we present FireLedger, which leverages the iterative nature of blockchains in order to improve their throughput in optimistic execution scenarios.

Yet, when optimistic assumptions are met, a new block is decided in each communication step, which consists of a proposer that sends only its proposal and all other participants are sending a single bit each.

"The recent adoption of blockchain technologies and open permissionless networks suggest the importance of peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain transaction protocols. Users should be able to atomically exchange tokens and assets without depending on centralized intermediaries such as exchanges. Recent peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain swap protocols use hashlocks and timelocks to ensure that participants comply to the protocol. However, an expired timelock could lead to a violation of the all-or-nothing atomicity property. An honest participant who fails to execute a smart contract on time due to a crash failure, denial of service attacks or even network delays might end up losing assets. Although a crashed participant is the only participant who ends up worse off, current proposals are unsuitable for atomic cross-chain transactions in asynchronous environments where crash failures and network delays are the norm. In this paper, we present AC3WN, the first decentralized all-or-nothing atomic cross-chain commitment protocol.

"The emergence of Blockchain has attracted widespread attention. However, we observe that in practice, many applications on permissioned blockchains do not benefit from the decentralized architecture. When decentralized architecture is used but not required, system performance is often restricted, resulting in low throughput, high latency, and significant storage overhead. Hence, we propose LedgerDB on Alibaba Cloud, which is a centralized ledger database with tamper-evidence and non-repudiation features similar to blockchain, and provides strong auditability. LedgerDB has much higher throughput compared to blockchains. It offers stronger auditability by adopting a TSA two-way peg protocol, which prevents malicious behaviors from both users and service providers. LedgerDB supports verifiable data removals demanded by many real-world applications, which are able to remove obsolete records for storage saving and hide records for regulatory purpose, without compromising its verifiability. Experimental evaluation shows that LedgerDB's throughput is 80X higher than state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric).

"Blockchain technology has emerged as the cornerstone of many decentralized applications operating among otherwise untrusted peers. However, it is well known that existing blockchain systems do not scale well. Transactions are often executed and committed sequentially in order to maintain the same view of the total order. Furthermore, it is necessary to duplicate both transaction data and their executions in every node in the blockchain network for integrity assurance. Such storage and computation requirements put significant burdens on the blockchain system, not only limiting system scalability but also undermining system security and robustness by making the network more centralized. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose SlimChain, a novel blockchain system that scales transactions through off-chain storage and parallel processing. Advocating a stateless design, SlimChain maintains only the short commitments of ledger states on-chain while dedicating transaction executions and data storage to off-chain nodes. To realize SlimChain, we propose new schemes for off-chain smart contract execution, on-chain transaction validation, and state commitment. We also propose optimizations to reduce network transmissions and a new sharding technique to improve system scalability further. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed SlimChain system. Compared with the existing systems, SlimChain reduces the on-chain storage requirements by 97% ~ 99%, while also improving the peak throughput by 1.4× ~ 15.6×.","[Cheng Xu, Ce Zhang, Jianliang Xu, Jian Pei]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[, , , ]",27 October 2021,27,"[Simon Fraser University and Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong Baptist University, Simon Fraser University]",October,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Simon Fraser University and Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong Baptist University, Simon Fraser University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ef1c

"Modern mobile applications often produce decentralized data, i.e., a huge amount of privacy-sensitive data distributed over a large number of mobile devices. Techniques for learning models from decentralized data must properly handle two natures of such data, namely privacy and massive engagement. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for such a learning task since the technique learns models from data without exposing privacy. However, traditional FL methods assume that the participating mobile devices are honest volunteers. This assumption makes traditional FL methods unsuitable for applications where two kinds of participants are engaged: 1) self-interested participants who, without economical stimulus, are reluctant to contribute their computing resources unconditionally, and 2) malicious participants who send corrupt updates to disrupt the learning process. This paper proposes Refiner, a reliable federated learning system for tackling the challenges introduced by massive engagements of self-interested and malicious participants. Refiner is built upon Ethereum, a public blockchain platform. To engage self-interested participants, we introduce an incentive mechanism which rewards each participant in terms of the amount of its training data and the performance of its local updates. To handle malicious participants, we propose an audit scheme which employs a committee of randomly chosen validators for punishing them with no reward and preclude corrupt updates from the global model. The proposed incentive and audit scheme is implemented with cryptocurrency and smart contract, two primitives offered by Ethereum. This paper demonstrates the main features of Refiner by training a digit classification model on the MNIST dataset.","[Zhebin Zhang, Dajie Dong, Yuhang Ma, Yilong Ying, Dawei Jiang, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou, Gang Chen]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[, , , , , , , ]",28 October 2021,28,"[Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University]",October,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University]",ACM,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ef1e

"With the emergence of hybrid blockchain database systems, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the performance and trade-offs among a few representative systems. To achieve this goal, we implement Veritas and BlockchainDB from scratch. For Veritas, we provide two flavors to target the crash fault-tolerant (CFT) and Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) application scenarios. Specifically, we implement Veritas with Apache Kafka to target CFT application scenarios, and Veritas with Tendermint to target BFT application scenarios. We compare these three systems with the existing open-source implementation of BigchainDB. BigchainDB uses Tender-mint for consensus and provides two flavors: a default implementation with blockchain pipelining and an optimized version that includes blockchain pipelining and parallel transaction validation. Our experimental analysis confirms that CFT designs, which are typically used by distributed databases, exhibit much higher performance than BFT designs, which are specific to blockchains. On the other hand, our extensive analysis highlights the variety of design choices faced by the developers and sheds some light on the trade-offs that need to be done when designing a hybrid blockchain database system.","[Zerui Ge, Dumitrel Loghin, Beng Chin Ooi, Pingcheng Ruan, Tianwen Wang]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[, , , , ]",18 May 2022,18,"[National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore]",May,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef25
"While permissioned blockchains enable a family of data center applications, existing systems suffer from imbalanced loads across compute and memory, exacerbating the underutilization of cloud resources. This paper presents FlexChain, a novel permissioned blockchain system that addresses this challenge by physically disaggregating CPUs, DRAM, and storage devices to process different blockchain workloads efficiently. Disaggregation allows blockchain service providers to upgrade and expand hardware resources independently to support a wide range of smart contracts with diverse CPU and memory demands. Moreover, it ensures efficient resource utilization and hence prevents resource fragmentation in a data center. We have explored the design of XOV blockchain systems in a disaggregated fashion and developed a tiered key-value store that can elastically scale its memory and storage. Our design significantly speeds up the execution stage. We have also leveraged several techniques to parallelize the validation stage in FlexChain to further improve the overall blockchain performance. Our evaluation results show that FlexChain can provide independent compute and memory scalability, while incurring at most 12.8% disaggregation overhead. FlexChain achieves almost identical throughput as the state-of-the-art distributed approaches with significantly lower memory and CPU consumption for compute-intensive and memory-intensive workloads respectively.","[Chenyuan Wu, Mohammad Javad Amiri, Jared Asch, Heena Nagda, Qizhen Zhang, Boon Thau Loo]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[, , , , , ]",16 November 2022,16,"[University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania]",November,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef26
"Blockchain serves as a replicated transactional processing system in a trustless distributed environment. Existing blockchain systems all rely on an explicit ordering step to determine the global order of transactions that are collected from multiple peers. The ordering consensus can be the bottleneck since it must be Byzantine-fault tolerant and can scarcely benefit from parallel execution. In this paper, we propose an ordering-free architecture that makes ordering implicit through deterministic execution. Based on this novel architecture, we develop a permissioned blockchain system NeuChain. A number of key optimizations such as asynchronous block generation and pipelining are leveraged for high throughput and low latency. Several security mechanisms are also designed to make our system robust to malicious attacks. Our geo-distributed experimental results show that NeuChain can achieve 47.2--64.1X throughput improvement over HyperLedger Fabric and 1.6--12.2X throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art high performance blockchains.","[Zeshun Peng, Yanfeng Zhang, Qian Xu, Haixu Liu, Yuxiao Gao, Xiaohua Li, Ge Yu]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[China, China, China, China, China, China, China]",29 September 2022,29,"[Northeastern University, China, Northeastern University, China, Northeastern University, China, Northeastern University, China, Northeastern University, China, Northeastern University, China, Northeastern University, China]",September,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Northeastern University, Northeastern University, Northeastern University, Northeastern University, Northeastern University, Northeastern University, Northeastern University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef27

"Crowdsourcing for Human Intelligence Tasks (HIT) has been widely used to crowdsource human knowledge, such as image annotation for machine learning. We use a public blockchain to play the role of traditional centralized HIT systems, such that the blockchain deals with cryptocurrency payments and acts as a trustworthy judge to resolve disputes between a worker and a requester in a decentralized setting, preventing false-reporting and free-riding. Our approach neither uses expensive cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, nor sends the worker's answers to the blockchain. Compared with prior works, our approach significantly reduces on-chain cost: it only requires O(1) on-chain storage and O(logN) smart contract computation, where N is the question number of a HIT. Additionally, our approach uses known answers or gold standards to determine the worker's answer quality. To motivate the requester to use honest known answers, the requester cannot learn the worker's answers if the answer quality does not meet the requirement. We further provide formal security definitions for our decentralized HIT and prove security of our construction.","[Yihuai Liang, Yan Li, Byeong-Seok Shin]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea]",27 July 2022,27,"[Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea]",July,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Inha University, Inha University, Inha University]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef29

Specifically, DQBFT divides consensus into two parts: 1) durable command replication without a global order, and 2) consistent global ordering of commands across all replicas.

"Applications in diverse domains such as astronomy, economics and industrial monitoring, increasingly press the need for analyzing massive collections of time series data. The sheer size of the latter hinders our ability to efficiently store them and also yields significant storage costs. Applying general purpose compression algorithms would effectively reduce the size of the data, at the expense of introducing significant computational overhead. Time Series Management Systems that have emerged to address the challenge of handling this overwhelming amount of information, cannot suffer the ingestion rate restrictions that such compression algorithms would cause. Data points are usually encoded using faster, streaming compression approaches. However, the techniques that contemporary systems use do not fully utilize the compression potential of time series data, with implications in both storage requirements and access times. In this work, we propose a novel streaming compression algorithm, suitable for floating point time series data. We empirically establish properties exhibited by a diverse set of time series and harness these features in our proposed encodings. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach readily outperforms competing techniques, attaining compression ratios that are competitive with slower general purpose algorithms, and on average around 50% of the space required by state-of-the-art streaming approaches. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms all earlier techniques with regards to both compression and access time, offering a significantly improved trade-off between space and speed. The aforementioned benefits of our approach - in terms of all space requirements, compression time and read access - significantly improve the efficiency in which we can store and analyze time series data.","[Panagiotis Liakos, Katia Papakonstantinopoulou, Yannis Kotidis]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[Greece, Greece, Greece]",29 September 2022,29,"[Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece, Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece, Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece]",September,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens University of Economics and Business, Athens University of Economics and Business]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef2c
"This paper presents Scalar DL, a Byzantine fault detection (BFD) middleware for transactional database systems. Scalar DL manages two separately administered database replicas in a database system and can detect Byzantine faults in the database system as long as either replica is honest (not faulty). Unlike previous BFD works, Scalar DL executes non-conflicting transactions in parallel while preserving a correctness guarantee. Moreover, Scalar DL is database-agnostic middleware so that it achieves the detection capability in a database system without either modifying the databases or using database-specific mechanisms. Experimental results with YCSB and TPC-C show that Scalar DL outperforms a state-of-the-art BFD system by 3.5 to 10.6 times in throughput and works effectively on multiple database implementations.

However, network K-function is a computationally expensive operation that is not feasible to support large-scale datasets, let alone to generate a network K-function plot. To handle this issue, we develop two efficient algorithms, namely count augmentation (CA) and neighbor sharing (NS), which can reduce the worst-case time complexity for computing network K-functions.

"Modern storage engines and key-value stores have come to rely on the log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) as their core data structure. LSM-tree operates by gradually merge-sorting data across levels of exponentially increasing capacities in storage. A crucial design dimension of LSM-tree is its compaction granularity. Some designs perform Full Merge, whereby entire levels get compacted at once. Others perform Partial Merge, whereby smaller groups of files with overlapping key ranges are compacted independently. This paper shows that both strategies exhibit serious flaws. With Full Merge, space-amplification is exorbitant. The reason is that while compacting the LSM-tree's largest level, there must be at least twice as much storage space as data to store both the original and new files until the compaction is finished. On the other hand, Partial Merge exhibits excessive write-amplification. The reason is twofold. (1) The files getting compacted typically do not have perfectly overlapping key ranges, and so some non-overlapping data is superfluously rewritten in each compaction. (2) Files with different lifetimes become interspersed within the SSD leading to high SSD garbage-collection overheads. As the data size grows, these problems grow in magnitude.","[Niv Dayan, Tamar Weiss, Shmuel Dashevsky, Michael Pan, Edward Bortnikov, Moshe Twitto]",Computer Science (miscellaneous) (Q1),"[, , , , , ]",29 September 2022,29,"[University of Toronto, Pliops, Pliops, Pliops, Pliops, Pliops]",September,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,Q1,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,RESEARCH-ARTICLE,"[University of Toronto, Pliops, Pliops, Pliops, Pliops, Pliops]",ACM,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef31

"Data isolation has become an obstacle to scale up query processing over big data, since sharing raw data among data owners is often prohibitive due to security concerns. A promising solution is to perform secure queries over a federation of multiple data owners leveraging secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques, as evidenced by recent federation work over relational data. However, existing solutions are highly inefficient on spatial queries due to excessive secure distance operations for query processing and their usage of general-purpose SMC libraries for secure operation implementation. In this paper, we propose Hu-Fu, the first system for efficient and secure spatial query processing on a data federation. The idea is to decompose the secure processing of a spatial query into as many plaintext operations and as few secure operations as possible, where fewer secure operators are involved and all secure operators are implemented dedicatedly. As a working system, Hu-Fu supports not only query input in native SQL, but also heterogeneous spatial databases (e.g., PostGIS, Simba, GeoMesa, and SpatialHadoop) at the backend.

"Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) works as the most advanced component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). In IoVs, vehicles are able to communicate with nearby vehicles or RoadSide Units (RSUs). Traffic safety and efficiency can be provided by collecting and uploading real-time traffic information through vehicles, as well as broadcasting information by RSUs. However, there may be malicious vehicles in the network uploading false information, which will lead to serious traffic problems. To alleviate this problem, a trust management system based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. In this system, vehicles in the network firstly collect information about their surroundings and then upload valid information to nearby RSUs. To prevent malicious vehicles from uploading false messages, this paper designs a deep learning based verification model to calculate the trustworthiness of uploaded messages, and to further obtain the credibility scores of vehicles using the calculated results, and detect malicious vehicles accordingly. Moreover, a public blockchain framework is proposed and a Proof-Of-Trust (POT) consensus algorithm is designed.

"Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) works as the most advanced component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). In IoVs, vehicles are able to communicate with nearby vehicles or RoadSide Units (RSUs). Traffic safety and efficiency can be provided by collecting and uploading real-time traffic information through vehicles, as well as broadcasting information by RSUs. However, there may be malicious vehicles in the network uploading false information, which will lead to serious traffic problems. To alleviate this problem, a trust management system based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. In this system, vehicles in the network firstly collect information about their surroundings and then upload valid information to nearby RSUs. To prevent malicious vehicles from uploading false messages, this paper designs a deep learning based verification model to calculate the trustworthiness of uploaded messages, and to further obtain the credibility scores of vehicles using the calculated results, and detect malicious vehicles accordingly. Moreover, a public blockchain framework is proposed and a Proof-Of-Trust (POT) consensus algorithm is designed. Vehicles are motivated to report true and valid information, and are penalized for uploading false data under this framework. Simulation results show that this mechanism can effectively detect malicious vehicles and motivate unfamiliar vehicles to upload true and reliable information to achieve trust management in the open and dynamic vehicular network environments.","[FarisElghaisha, M.

"The global trend of credentialism as well as increased mobility in studies and work bring new requirements regarding the verification of academic qualifications. So far, traditional nostrification processes face challenges related to high process cycle times, elevated fees, and fraud incidents. In the higher education domain, blockchain-based approaches have emerged to revitalize the verification of academic qualifications, but they mostly rely on closed concepts offering their facility to a limited circle of entities. As a result, the verification of degrees is not publicly available to any third party. Moreover, in most cases, a concise process-aware approach describing the intended functionality with appropriate models is missing; this absence raises ambiguity and trust issues in the implemented application. This paper presents the design and early implementation of the VerDe (Verified Degrees) platform; a proposed blockchain-based application for registration and verification of academic qualifications. The novelty of the approach presented in this paper is the implementation of VerDe as a decentralized application utilizing Business Process Model & Notation (BPMN). This work demonstrates that usage of BPMN constructs provides an efficient method in addressing blockchain usability and complexity issues and facilitates the design and implementation of blockchain-based applications. The benefits of deploying VerDe in conjunction with BPMN are an efficient and transparent facility able to handle mobility consequences, detect fraud, and overcome administrative barriers by offering the verification capability to any third-party, and employing a custom-made token that emulates the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).","[Tsan-MingChoia, TanaSiqinb]",Hardware and Architecture (Q1); Modeling and Simulation (Q1); Software (Q2),[], December 2022,,[],December,Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory,Q1,Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef3f

"As a key component of smart grid (SG), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) realizes two-way communication between users and power companies. Considering that AMI involves a large number of important data, which are related to the measurement of users’ electricity bills and the decision-making of power suppliers. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of AMI data security and privacy to avoid economic losses caused by data leakage and tampering. Aiming at the problems of trust and single point of failure in the existing protection schemes, this paper proposes an AMI security framework based on blockchain. By combining the characteristics of blockchain such as decentration, tamper proof, traceability, the architecture of AMI data management system is reshaped. The technologies of peer-to-peer (P2P) transmission, asymmetric encryption, consensus algorithm and smart contract of blockchain are used to solve the problems of secure storage, transmission and application of AMI data. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the feasibility of introducing blockchain technology into AMI is verified. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and reliable, which provides a strong guarantee for AMI data security and privacy protection.","[XiangChu, RuiWang, YanLin, YantongLi]","Control and Systems Engineering (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1); Energy Engineering and Power Technology (Q1); Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment (Q2)",[], December 2022,,[],December,"Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks",Q1,"Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks",,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef44

"Blockchain technology is considered a logical solution to the problems of security, privacy and trust in the collection, storage and sharing of data related to the elderly in the elderly care industry (ECI); however, its adoption in the ECI remains in its initial stage. To improve the efficiency of adopting this technology in the ECI and to facilitate decision-making by managers, this study combines the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology–organisation–environment framework models to study the factors affecting blockchain adoption intention in the ECI. In addition, the direct predictors of the relative advantages of blockchain technology in the ECI are explored. Through a questionnaire survey of 124 elderly care institutions in China, we collected 181 valid questionnaires and analysed them using a partial least squares regression structural equation model. The results show that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility, top management support and organisational readiness have a positive effect on blockchain adoption intention in the ECI, while the effects of complexity, government support and competitive pressure are insignificant. However, competitive pressure and government support can indirectly promote blockchain adoption intention by influencing top management support. Furthermore, technology trust and information security positively affect the relative advantages of blockchain technology and indirectly affect blockchain adoption intention, while privacy protection is insignificant.","[NazirUllaha, Waleed MugahedAl-Rahmib, OsamaAlfarrajc, NasserAlalwand, Ahmed IbrahimAlzahranie, T.Ramayahfghi, VikasKumarj]",Business and International Management (Q1); Education (Q1); Human Factors and Ergonomics (Q1); Sociology and Political Science (Q1),[], November 2021,,[],November,Technology in Society,Q1,Technology in Society,,[],Sciences Directes,2021,63ae010034ac983172e7ef4d

"Due to the vast advantages of Blockchain technology, especially transparency of information and the ability to track transactions, this technology has been considered in several areas, including supply chain management (SCM). However, due to the emergence of this technology, numerous barriers and limitations have hindered its use. Due to the special conditions of developing countries (such as Iran), there is still a need for independent research to localize these barriers in these countries. On the other hand, most of the research has focused more on identifying barriers and less on prioritizing them. Examining the specific features of the Blockchain technology field shows that there is a need to provide a decision-making framework based on large-scale group decision-making methods (LSGDM), which, in addition to simultaneously paying attention to the advantages of previous approaches (including the participation of different groups of stakeholders; the consensus reaching process (CRP) as well as the uncertainty and doubt of the stakeholders in the evaluations), can increase the applicability of the method by reducing the number of pairwise comparisons. Therefore, while identifying and localizing the list of barriers in Iran, the LSGDM method along with the proposed consensus framework can be used to aggregate the opinions between the experts in a network and create a relative consensus between them. The use of hesitant fuzzy (HF) sets has made it possible to model the uncertainty and hesitancy in the opinions of experts. Also, using the Best-Worst method (BWM) instead of the pairwise comparison approach between all criteria, has reduced the number of pairwise comparisons and provided other advantages such as reduced inconsistency and higher reliability. The results of applying this framework in Iran showed that lack of awareness and customer orientation, scalability and lack of management participation and support are the main barriers to the implementation of the blockchain for SCM in this developing country. The results can help decision makers and policy makers in this area to plan more accurately.","[BaozhuangNiua, HaotaoXua, LeiChenb]",Business and International Management (Q1); Education (Q1); Human Factors and Ergonomics (Q1); Sociology and Political Science (Q1),[], November 2022,,[],November,Technology in Society,Q1,Technology in Society,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef53
"Despite its perceived utility, several companies and managers continue to hold reservations about blockchain implementation in supply chain management. To elucidate the causes, we examine the behavioural and organisational antecedents that influence the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management. To do this, we undertake thematic analysis on blockchain-related agri-food business news and expert opinions from the Ovid database's Agricola section. Four themes are central to our model: organisational adoption strategies, technical advantages, environmental obstacles, and implementation intention. Using these themes, we build a thematic map and derive three propositions about the role of behavioural antecedents to blockchain implementation intention in supply chains, thus substantiating Behavioural Reasoning Theory (BRT) and Technology Organisation and Environment (TOE) theory's core arguments. Our findings elucidate novel factors influencing blockchain adoption in supply chains. More specifically, we show that managers who consider the technological benefits associated with blockchain capacity are able to provide stakeholders with new opportunities and embrace adoption strategies such as product launch and partnership formation while also considering environmental and contextual barriers such as market fragmentation, scarcity of research, and regulatory restrictions.","[Arun SekarRajasekarana, MariaAzeesa, FadiAl-Turjmanb]",Business and International Management (Q1); Education (Q1); Human Factors and Ergonomics (Q1); Sociology and Political Science (Q1),[], February 2022,,[],February,Technology in Society,Q1,Technology in Society,,[],Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef54
"The technological revolution in blockchain achieved the healthcare sector and offered a significant opportunity to lead this digital transformation. A significant problem is that various healthcare organizations keep numerous and fragmented patient medical records. The proposed platform solves this problem by integrating electronic medical reports in a private and permissioned blockchain to create a distributed electronic health record (EHR) ecosystem. In this context, the information processing theory (IPT) allowed us to design and validate a blockchain-based EHR system enhancing the storage of medical records and data exchange among healthcare providers and reducing environmental uncertainty. The potential benefits of the implementation of our distributed network regard clinical outcomes (e.g., improved quality, reduced medical errors), organizational outcomes (e.g., financial, operational benefits), and managerial outcomes (e.g., improved ability to conduct research, improved population health, reduced costs).

"The most advanced and emerging component of an intelligent transportation system (ITS) is the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Vehicles communicate with nearby vehicles or road side units (RSUs) in order to provide safety or non-safety information. This information containing vehicle ID, current position, speed and vehicle status is shared periodically among nearby vehicles. VANET provides tremendous benefits to drivers, but due to its inherent characteristics, it is important to address security and privacy issues before it can be fully adopted. It is required to authenticate the vehicles participating in the network and held responsible in case any type of misbehavior is encountered in the network. Traditional centralized security solutions are not suitable in VANET because of high speed of vehicles, minimal communication resources and delay sensitive applications. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed computing platform that makes it easier to record and manage resources without relying on a centralized trusted authority. Therefore, blockchain based solution is expedient in VANET scenario which provides transparency, tamper resistance and immutableness. This paper aims to envision a comprehensive review on applications of blockchain in VANET security. We first present the introduction of VANET security and blockchain. Then, we conduct a literature review on the existing security solutions using blockchain in VANET by considering the technical issues and research problems.

"In the study, we propose a double blockchain based vehicular system for optimizing data storage and securing communication in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. We propose an incentive mechanism and a reputation system to reduce the selfish and distrustful behavior of IoV nodes. Moreover, we propose an encryption technique to protect the proposed system from passive and active attacks. The proposed technique is a hybrid of Rivest Shamir Adleman and Advanced Encryption Standard-256 (AES-256+RSA). We use this hybrid approach to efficiently and secretly share the users' secret keys. To address the issues of high resource consumption and communication delay, we propose a cache memory technique for miner and controller nodes. In addition, we propose an authentication mechanism to remove malicious nodes from the system. The simulation results depict that our system provides security, scalability, optimized data storage, node's trustworthiness, and transparent data sharing.","[Adamu SaniYahayaa, NadeemJavaidab, SheraliZeadallyc, HassanFarooqa]",Automotive Engineering (Q1); Communication (Q1); Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Q1),"[Pakistan, Pakistan, USA, Pakistan]", October 2022,,"[Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan, Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan, College of Communication and Information, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0224, USA, Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan]",October,Vehicular Communications,Q1,Vehicular Communications,,"[Department of Computer Science, Department of Computer Science, College of Communication and Information, Department of Computer Science]",Sciences Directes,2022,63ae010034ac983172e7ef57
