        "abstract": "Blockchain has been relevant in the document management process, serving as a storage solution with the potential to guarantee the relevant requirements needed for any document storage and validation solution. However, due to the distributed nature of blockchain, we may face implementation difficulties and high operational costs, for example. To facilitate this process, we propose a customizable blockchain-based document registration service that makes it possible to create different types of gen-eralized documents for various application domains and store them in one or more blockchains integrated in an Application Programming Interface (API).",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has attracted wide attention because of its characteristics of transparency, anti-interference, traceability, decentralization and verification. The traditional blockchain ensures the reliability of all data by making it public, thus reaching consensus and maintaining the consistency of the global state. This means that everyone's transaction data is phanic to the outside world, resulting in a massive breach of users' personal privacy. Since this reason, we propose a new kind of blockchain privacy protection scheme, which applies the trusted execution environment in the blockchain, designs an encrypted communication and authentication scheme, and realizes the function of providing privacy protection for the blockchain. And most of the computations are moved out of the chain, which greatly reduces the delay and burden of on-chain computations. Experiments show that this architecture has good confidentiality and usability.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. Mainly, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain architecture that combines private and public blockchains to allow sensitive bids to be opened on a private blockchain so that only the auctioneer can learn the bids, and no one else. At the same time, we leverage public blockchains to make the auction winner announcement, and payments accountable. Furthermore, using smart contracts deployed on public blockchain, we show how to incentivize truthful behavior among the auction participants. Our extensive empirical results show that this architecture is more efficient in terms of run time and monetary cost compared to pure public blockchain based aucti...",

        "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have elicited tremendous interest in the recent past due to their ability to enable financial transactions without the need for a central authority. The most appealing aspect of cryptocurrencies that garnered significant attention is its potential to enable (pseudo) anonymous transactions on the blockchain ledger. Unsurprisingly, this has led to rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies for unlawful activities by malicious actors in several ways. Hence, to detect these unlawful activities, it is essential to analyze the blockchain ledgers to derive insights by investigating anonymous transactions and activities, which is where blockchain forensics comes in. In this paper, we present a taxonomy mapping the identified high-level forensics features with the supporting forensics tools that we surveyed. We provide a comparison of the surveyed tools using three practical parameters (number of cryptocurrencies supported, number of features provided and ease of accessing services) and give an overview of their theoretical effectiveness in general with some open challenges identified.",

Yet the number of investors in RE are much lower, because of the liquidity and global access. Tenants, owners, and investors are barely satisfied in the current system. In this paper, the goal is to try out the employment of blockchain in RE market and represent the facilities it can give to the RE market. The research to date leads to the following conclusions: Blockchain technology and smart contracts can sort out the classical issues that RE is facing with, and they offer much more meaningful tools for a game theoretic stable-priced market.",

        "abstract": "The blockchain technology becomes a key facilitator for Intelligent Manufacturing as it enables intelligent nodes to participate in global manufacturing networks with secure ledgers and smart contracts features. However, Traditional centralized storage cannot meet performance and security requirements and fully distributed storage consumes a large amount of computing, storage and network resources, which is inefficient and difficult to implement. In this paper, we propose a clustering strategy on node community clustering by constructing a trust model based on the decentralization of blockchain technology. We introduce a multi-chain storage structure. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy reduces data synchronization time and storage space, improves system performance by enabling efficient parallel processing.",

A Blockchain network uses the multi-party agreement concept to reach an agreement on the transaction confirmation. As the technology is new, tools and techniques for blockchain verification are still under development. We explore optimization techniques of weighted multi-party agreements with stochastic properties in the current work. We represent a multiparty agreement as a discrete-time Markov chain and specification in a probabilistic linear temporal logic form. We demonstrate how to change the protocol parameters to satisfy the specification and illustrate the work of algorithms in experiments. Finally, we discuss the usage of proposed algorithms in the Hyperledger Fabric framework.",

        "abstract": "The global Electronic Health Record (EHR) market is growing dramatically and expected to reach $39.7 billions by 2022. To safe-guard security and privacy of EHR, access control is an essential mechanism for managing EHR data. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture to facilitate access control of EHR data by using both blockchain and edge node. Within the architecture, a blockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and serves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge nodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data in collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs. We evaluate the proposed hybrid architecture by utilizing Hyperledger Composer Fabric blockchain to measure the performance of executing smart contracts and ACL policies in terms of transaction processing time and response time against unauthorized data retrieval.",

        "abstract": "A neural key exchange is a secret key exchange technique based on neural synchronization of the neural network. Since the neural key exchange is based on synchronizing weights within the neural network structure, the security of the algorithm does not depend on the attacker's computational capabilities. However, due to the neural key exchange's repetitive mutual-learning processes, using explicit user authentication methods -such as a public key certificate- is inefficient due to high communication overhead. Implicit authentication based on information that only authorized users know can significantly reduce overhead in communications. However, there was a lack of realistic methods to distribute secret information for authentication among authorized users. In this paper, we propose the concept idea of distributing shared secret values for implicit authentication based on the randomness of the public blockchain. Moreover, we present a method to prevent the unintentional disclosure of shared secret values to third parties in the network due to the transparency of the blockchain.",

        "abstract": "User privacy is an attractive and valuable task to the success of blockchain systems. However, user privacy protection's performance and data capacity have not been well studied in existing access control models of blockchain systems because of traceability and openness of the P2P network. This paper focuses on investigating performance and data capacity from a blockchain infrastructure perspective, which adds secondary encryption to shield confidential information in a non-invasive way. First, we propose an efficient asymmetric encryption scheme by combining homomorphic encryption and state-of-the-art multi-signature key aggregation to preserve privacy. Second, we use smart contracts and CA infrastructure to achieve attribute-based access control. Then, we use the non-interactive zero-knowledge proof scheme to achieve secondary confidentiality explicitly. Finally, experiments show our scheme succeeds better performance in data capacity and system than other schemes. This scheme improves availability and robust scalability, solves the problem of multi-signature key distribution and the unlinkability of transactions. Our scheme has established a sound security cross-chain system and privacy confidentiality mechanism and that has more excellent performance and higher system computing ability than other schemes.",

        "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are poised to revolutionize the modern economy by democratizing commerce. These currencies operate on top of blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Existing permissionless blockchain-based protocols offer unparalleled benefits like decentralization, anonymity, and transparency. However, these protocols suffer in performance which hinders their widespread adoption. In particular, high time-to-finality and low transaction rates keep them from replacing centralized payment systems such as the Visa network. Permissioned blockchain protocols offer attractive performance guarantees, but they are not considered suitable for deploying decentralized cryptocurrencies due to their centralized nature. Researchers have developed several multi-layered blockchain protocols that combine both permissioned and permissionless blockchain protocols to achieve high performance along with decentralization. The key idea with existing layered blockchain protocols in literature is to divide blockchain operations into two layers and use different types of consensus to manage each layer. However, many such works come with the assumptions of honest majority which may not accurately reflect the real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational. These assumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by the literature focused on exploring game-theoretic attacks on these protocols. We generalize the \u201clayered\u201d approach taken by existing protocols in the literature and present a framework to analyze the system in the BAR Model and provide a generalized game-theoretic analysis of such protocols. Using our analysis, we identify the critical system parameters required for a distributed ledger\u2019s secure operation in a more realistic setting.",

        "abstract": "Conventional blockchain implementations with append-only semantics do not support deleting or overwriting data in confirmed blocks. However, many industry-relevant use cases require the ability to delete data, especially when personally identifiable information is stored or when data growth has to be constrained. Existing attempts to reconcile these contradictions compromise on core qualities of the blockchain paradigm, as they include backdoor-like approaches such as central authorities with elevated rights or usage of specialized chameleon hash algorithms in chaining of the blocks. The contribution of this paper is a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and consensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. A context chain captures the transactions of a closed group of entities and persons, thus structuring blocks in a precisely defined way. The resulting context isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context without side effects to other contexts. We show how this architecture supports truncation, data rollover and separation of concerns, how the GDPR regulations can be fulfilled by this architecture and how it differs from sidechains and state channels.",

If the number of renewable electricity-producing/consuming facilities reached two million, an enormous number of transactions would be invoked beyond blockchain's scalability.We propose mutually cooperative two novel methods to simultaneously solve scalability, data size, and privacy problems in blockchain-based trading platforms for renewable energy environmental value. One is a management scheme of electricity production resources (EPRs) using an extended UTXO token. The other is a data aggregation scheme that aggregates a significant number of smart meter records with evidentiality using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technologies have recently received considerable attention, partly due to the success of cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the adoption of blockchain technologies by various sectors increases, there is a demand for tools that enable regulatory enforcement, which include monitoring, examining and ensuring compliance of the data stored by the blockchain systems, all in a privacy preserving way. Current blockchain solutions store transactions in append-only and immutable fashion without any indexing, which contributes to limited and inefficient queries. Additionally, there is no support for privacy-preserving query processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a system that can provide auditors, enforcing regulatory compliance, with efficient, scalable and richer blockchain query processing over Hadoop and synchronized Ethereum clients. The system additionally ensures auditors' privacy by utilizing cryptography techniques over semi-trusted servers to protect the auditors' identities, queries and their results.",

        "abstract": "The main advantage of the Bitcoin-style blockchain systems is immutability of data and decentralized authority. Despite its success, Bitcoin suffers from scalability issues. The potential of the blockchain technology cannot be fully realized unless it is made more scalable. We extend previous analysis on a fundamental trade-off between the throughput and forking rate of the blockchain system. We further propose FastChain to increase the throughput of the blockchain system by reducing the block propagation time. FastChain adopts bandwidth-informed neighbor selection. Miners disconnect from bandwidth-limited neighbors and favor the nodes with higher bandwidth. We build a Blockchain Dynamics Simulator (BDSim) to evaluate the performance of FastChain. FastChain improves the throughput by 20%~40% in the normal operations.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has been treated as one of the most promising technologies to promote crowdsourcing by providing new nice features, such as decentralization and accountability. Unfortunately, some inherent limitations of blockchain have been rarely addressed by the most existing works when applying blockchain into crowdsourcing, which becomes the performance bottleneck of crowdsourcing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain crowdsourcing platform to achieve decentralization and privacy preservation. Our platform integrates with a hybrid blockchain structure, dual-ledgers, and dual consensus algorithms to ensure secure communication between the requesters and the workers. Moreover, the smart contract and zero-knowledge proof are employed to ensure automatic operation of the tasks and the protection users' privacy, respectively. Finally, we conduct experiments to confirm the efficiency of the adopted consensus algorithm on our platform by comparing it with the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, electronic medical records(EMR) have became a new type of digital medical service instead of handwritten paper medical records. However, due to different medical institutions belong to different trustworthy domains, there exites barriers to health data exchang, interoperability, and so on. Considering that it was difficult to share medical record data among different medical institutions, we propose an blockchain based EMR data sharing scheme with searchable and verifiable encryption, i.e. SV-DEMR. In SV-DEMR, we propose a hybrid chain which includes consortium chain and private chain. To acheive the secure storage and sharing of EMR, we use the medical institution server to store the EMR ciphertext, the private chain to store the ciphertext hash value, and the consortium chain to share the ciphertext and key parameters. Moreover, we also propose a CP-ABE algorithm that ciphertext searchable and identity verifiable to realize access control and guarantee authenticity of data and efficient index of ciphertext on the blockchain, named SV-CPABE. Finally, the security of our SV-DEMR is proved theoretically. The extensive experiments are made to demonstrate the better performance in SV-DEMR.",

These intelligent devices have been producing a huge amout of useful data over time, however there is still a lack of a platform which can efficiently transfer and utilize the value of the massive IoT data. Blockchain is able to transfer value with a relative low cost, which makes it possible for the data from smart devices to create economic value.

        "abstract": "The rapid increase in the number of mobile smart devices has led to an exponential growth in user data. With the access of a large number of heterogeneous edge devices and the in-depth development of edge computing technology in various fields, it has brought huge challenges to the security management and data privacy protection in the edge computing architecture. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight edge computing data privacy-preserving scheme based on blockchain and homomorphic encryption. Above all, set edge computing servers as distributed nodes of the blockchain network and utilize the decentralization of blockchain and the non-tamperable characteristics of information to ensure the distributed storage of data and information recording. Then, designing a blockchain data encryption transmission scheme based on homomorphic encryption which could guarantee data transmission between edge nodes in the form of homomorphic ciphertext. Meanwhile, supporting the verification of the legality and correctness of the transaction in the form of ciphertext. Simulation experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can carry out effective data encryption transmission and has certain application potential.",

        "abstract": "We present a blockchain based system that allows data owners, cloud vendors, and AI developers to collaboratively train machine learning models in a trustless AI marketplace. Data is a highly valued digital asset and central to deriving business insights. Our system enables data owners to retain ownership and privacy of their data, while still allowing AI developers to leverage the data for training. Similarly, AI developers can utilize compute resources from cloud vendors without loosing ownership or privacy of their trained models. Our system protocols are set up to incentivize all three entities - data owners, cloud vendors, and AI developers to truthfully record their actions on the distributed ledger, so that the blockchain system provides verifiable evidence of wrongdoing and dispute resolution. Our system is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric and can provide a viable alternative to centralized AI systems that do not guarantee data or model privacy. We present experimental performance results that demonstrate the latency and throughput of its transactions under different network configurations where peers on the blockchain may be spread across different datacenters and geographies. Our results indicate that the proposed solution scales well to large number of data and model owners and can train up to 70 models per second on a 12-peer non optimized blockchain network and roughly 30 models per second in a 24 peer network.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to rapid technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), a smart public safety (SPS) system has become feasible by integrating heterogeneous computing devices to collaboratively provide public protection services. While service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure. Inspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper proposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for Smart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access control in an SPS system. The functionality of security services is decoupled into separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart contract and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes. An extensive experimental study verified that the proposed BlendMAS is able to offer a decentralized, scalable and secured data sharing and access control to distributed IoT based SPS system.",

        "abstract": "Witnessing the increasingly pervasive deployment of security video surveillance systems(VSS), more and more individuals have become concerned with the issues of privacy violations. While the majority of the public have a favorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not accept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the traceability of assets in a permissioned blockchain connected with a permissionless blockchain. We make traceability of assets in the permissioned blockchain be defined and be expressed as a hidden Markov model. There exists no dishonest increase and decrease of assets in this model. The condition is called balance. As we encrypt this model with fully homomorphic encryption and apply the zero knowledge proof of plaintext knowledge, we show that the trace-ability and balance of the permissioned blockchain are able to be proved in zero knowledge to the permissionless blockchain with concealing the asset allocation of the permissioned blockchain.",

In particular, the context of medicine exercise poses as a crucial one, since the professionals involved in this field are responsible for dealing with the health of third parties. However, we may notice a number of incidents and frauds related to the professionals records of physicians, such as issuing forged diplomas or availability of information not validated. In order to avoid these frauds, one can highlight the relevance of investigating innovative solutions aiming to maintain in a safe and transparent way the professional history of each doctor. In this context, our objective and major contribution is to present MIRIAM, a blockchain-based web application based on the Hyperledger platform, that allows, in a decentralized and reliable fashion, the storage of relevant information necessary for managing registrations of medical professionals. In addition, we explored the Brazilian regulatory framework to clarify the solution's feasibility in a real-world workflow scenario.",

        "abstract": "IoT devices have the characteristics of limited performance and mobility, which makes it difficult for traditional centralized security authentication methods to support security authentication in the current IoT environment. In order to cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a security authentication system named iot-chain in the Internet of Things, which provides attribute-based security authentication based on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. The system contains three kinds of chain codes, namely access code, device code, and policy code. The access code is the main program that implements the user safety authentication method. The device code provides a query method for the URL of the resource data generated by the storage device, and the policy code provides the access control strategy for the administrator user. Combining access control and blockchain technology, iot-chain provides dynamic security authentication management in the Internet of Things. Experimental results show that iot-chain can maintain high throughput and effectively reach consensus in a distributed system.",

In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based travel rule compliance system that supports fully-decentralized data exchange. The proposed system uses a permissioned blockchain, and thereby eliminates the possibility of leakage of personal information to third parties or even to travel rule service providers, and ensures that travel rule data can be managed securely.",

        "abstract": "Publish/subscribe is a communication paradigm used in distributed applications to easily exchange messages. This paradigm usually has a centralized architecture where a broker is responsible for transferring all the messages, hence can be a source of trust issues. In a threat model where the broker can be malicious, two honest entities cannot be sure of the origin of a message. There exist propositions for distributed publish/subscribe protocols replacing the broker by a blockchain. Those propositions all have in common an extensive usage of the blockchain, which makes them expensive over time, due to blockchain fees, and not scalable. In this paper, we introduce SUPRA, a distributed publish/subscribe protocol. This protocol has the same security guarantees than other solutions relying on blockchains, but where the vast majority of messages are off-chain. The message exchanges are done mostly directly between publishers and subscribers and the blockchain is only used in case of network issues, if a message is lost, or an entity is suspected to be malicious.",

        "abstract": "The revolutionary concept of blockchain, the technology behind the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin and its successors, has ushered in a new era in the Internet and online services. While most people focus only on cryptocurrencies when they think about Blockchain, in fact many administrative activities and day-to-day services are managed offline and/or privately are now being securely transferred to the Internet as online services. Electronic Voting is one of the trending and important aspect of online services. Traditional voting systems in our country include the use of ballots at polling stations or EVM's (Electronic Voting Machine). The ballot system is prone to tampering, whereas EVM's being a centralised system, are prone to hacking. We aim to offer a more secure, transparent, safer, cheaper and easier to use alternative to the above methods of voting, by making use of the revolutionary Blockchain technology. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of code that are incorporated into the Blockchain and implemented on schedule at each stage of the Blockchain update. Ethereum and its network is one of the most convenient due to its stability, wide usability and smart contract logic. In this work, we will be implementing and testing a prototype of an E-Voting application using Ethereum Wallet and Solidity language as a smart contract for the Ethereum network.",

In particular, the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric platform is evaluated in terms of: (a) throughput, i.e., successful transactions per second; (b) latency, i.e., response time per transaction in seconds; and (c) scalability, i.e., number of participants serviceable by the platform. The results indicate that the instance of Hyperledger Fabric platform being implemented can support up to 100,000 participants on the selected AWS EC2 instance. As long as the transaction rate is maintained within 200 transactions per seconds, the network latency is in the order of fraction of a second.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is seen as a promising technology to provide reliable and secure services due to its decentralized characteristic. However, because of the limited throughput, current blockchain platforms can not meet the transaction demand in practical use. Though researchers proposed many new solutions, they suffered either decentralization or security issues. In this paper, using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, we improve the linear structure of traditional blockchain protocol. In the new structure, blocks are organized in levels and width, which will generate into a compacted DAG structure (CoDAG). To make CoDAG more efficient and secure, we design algorithms and protocols to place the new-generated blocks appropriately. Compared with traditional blockchain protocols, CoDAG improves the security and transaction verification time, and enjoys the consistency and liveness properties of blockchain. Taking adversary parties into consideration, two possible attack strategies are presented in this paper, and we further prove that CoDAG is a secure and robust protocol to resist them. The experimental results show that CoDAG can achieve 394 transactions per second, which is 56 times of Bitcoin's throughput and 26 times of Ethereum's.",

In this paper, we adopt a multiple input LSTM-based prediction model in conjunction with the Black-Scholes (BS) model to address this challenge in Bitcoin option pricing. We discuss the relationship between on/off-chain transactions and predict the implied price volatility of the next 30 days, which is the main factor in the BS model. First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters. Finally, we compare the performance with the baseline model without Blockchain statistics inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-input LSTM-based prediction model provides the risk-informed pricing of the Bitcoin call options and our Blockchain statistics reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by up to 46.2%.",

        "abstract": "At an era of new emerging technologies, and spotting lights to blockchain technology specifically; many promises take place. Blockchain has attracted many researchers and practitioners from various professions and disciplines, due to the powerful characteristics behind adopting such technology. And in order to formulate a better understanding of it, many researchers are interested in classifying the Blockchain-Based Software Systems (BBSSs). Unfortunately, none of the available taxonomies in the literature considers the various Software Engineering (SWE) aspects for building a BBSS. A blockchain subject matter expert (SME) may absorb a specific aspect understanding from each of the related taxonomies, and in order to have a complete understanding of the various options available for building a BBSS, they will have to flip from a resource to another in order to collect the scattered information they need. So, this paper aims to assist the blockchain SMEs to articulate a comprehensive understanding of the various and most recent concepts and design decisions available, in order to implement or propose a BBSS solution. The taxonomy is derived from the fundamental knowledge and the major SWE aspects which a BBSS implementer or researcher has to consider, and thus is not biased to a specific SWE aspect.",

The energy trading is based on a double auction with multiple sellers and multiple buyers; the matched price and volume are determined by a trade reduction mechanism. We benchmark the performance of Ethereum using a systematic blockchain performance evaluation method. Based on this, we propose and analyze an efficient market operation method. In particular, we relate the limits on the scalability and real-time performance of the market to the throughput and latency of the Ethereum platform. We also identify the minimum resources necessary to operate an Ethereum client.",

        "abstract": "While the Bitcoin and Ethereum are still leading the world of permissionless blockchains, we are increasingly seeing a multipolar ecosystem where new blockchains keep emerging instead of migrating to the two big players. As a result, it is highly desired to enable multiple blockchains to interoperate, e.g., move assets from one blockchain to the other. The crosschain bridge service, as a solution to the blockchain interoperability problem, has been offered by a wide range of service providers. However, the existing bridges either rely on centralised notaries or require complicated preparations, therefore are far from sufficient in practice. In this demo proposal, we highlight the Poly Bridge for heterogeneous blockchains to interoperate with cryptocurrencies. In specific, Poly Bridge is based on an un-derlying Poly Chain and a pair of relays to confirm crosschain transactions and form consensus among relevant parties. More importantly, Poly Bridge delivers extensibility to flexibly inter-face to blockchains with different consensus models and atomicity as well in a way that a sequence of crosschain operations are either all confirmed or all rejected. Poly Bridge is now available as a web application to support crosschain requests with over 200 types of cryptocurrencies on 18 blockchains.",

        "abstract": "The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file system that seeks to decentralize the web and to make it faster and more efficient. It incorporates well-known technologies, including BitTorrent and Git, to create a swarm of computing systems that share information. Since its introduction in 2016, IPFS has seen great improvements and adoption from both individuals and enterprise organizations. Its distributed network allows users to share files and information across the globe. IPFS works well with large files that may consume or require large bandwidth to upload and/or download over the Internet. The rapid adoption of this distributed file system is in part because IPFS is designed to operate on top of different protocols, such as FTP and HTTP. However, there are underpinning concerns relating to security and access control, for example lack of traceability on how the files are accessed. The aim of this paper is to complement IPFS with blockchain technology, by proposing a new approach (BlockIPFS) to create a clear audit trail. BlockIPFS allows us to achieve improved trustworthiness of the data and authorship protection, and provide a clear route to trace back all activities associated with a given file using blockchain as a service.",

        "abstract": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

        "abstract": "Information sharing is very important for efficient ship integrated logistics support. However, with the increase of the complexity and informatization of ship equipment, the amount of data generated in the life cycle of ship is becoming more and more detailed and complicated. In order to solve the problems existing in the information sharing of the current ship integrated logistics support systems, such as low accuracy of information, insufficient information timeliness, low information security and lack of information sharing. From the perspective of the whole life cycle of ship, this paper proposes an information sharing prototype system of ship integrated logistics support based on blockchain. The system is constructed based on browser-server architecture. Hyperledger Fabric is used as the blockchain development platform of the system. This paper provides some insights into the informatization of ship integrated logistics support management and the application of blockchain technology.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain performance cannot meet the requirement nowadays. One of the crucial ways to improve performance is sharding. However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on the public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, multiple-shard contract calling, strict transaction atomicity, and shard availability, which are essential requirements but also challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving flexible multiple-shard contract calling. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. On a test-bed of 128 AliCloud servers, setting 32 shards and 4 consortium members, Meepo-OpenEtheruem can achieve more than 140,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions. It also shows more than 50,000 TPS under the transactions of real-world shopping behaviors.",

        "abstract": "A blockchain is a distributed ledger in which participants that do not fully trust each other agree on the ledger's content by running a consensus algorithm. This technology is raising a lot of interest both in academia and industry, but the lack of tools to evaluate design and implementation decisions may hamper fast progress. To address this issue, this paper presents a discrete-event simulator that is flexible enough to evaluate different blockchain implementations. These blockchains can be rapidly modeled and simulated by extending existing models. Running Bitcoin and Ethereum simulations allowed us to change conditions and answer different questions about their performance. For example, we concluded that doubling the number of transactions per block has a low impact on the block propagation delay (10ms) and that encrypting communication has a high impact in that delay (more than 25%).",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technologies are one possible avenue for increasing the resilience of the Smart Grid, by decentralizing the monitoring and control of system-level objectives such as voltage stability protection. They furthermore offer benefits in data immutability and traceability, as blockchains are cryptographically secured. However, the performance of blockchain-based systems in real-time grid monitoring and control has never been empirically tested. This study proposes implementing a decentralized voltage stability algorithm using blockchain-based smart contracts, as a testbed for evaluating the performance of blockchains in real-time control. We furthermore investigate sharding mechanisms as a means of improving the system's scalability with fixed computing resources. We implement our models as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric as our blockchain platform, the Matpower library in MATLAB as our power system simulator, and Hyperledger Caliper as our performance evaluation tool. We found that sharding does indeed lead to a substantial improvement in system scalability for this domain, measured by both transaction success rates and transaction latency.",

One of the difficulties blockchain researchers are facing is a lack of ways to verify behaviors of large scale blockchain networks. In this demonstration, we present SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator. It simulates the peer-to-peer network of a public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin, which consists of thousands of nodes, as well as parameters related to a blockchain and its network are flexibly configurable. SimBlock can also visualize nodes' behavior and block propagation. By giving some example studies, such as exploring better neighbor selection strategies and assessing the influence of relay networks, we show that SimBlock can facilitate blockchain network research.",

        "abstract": "Improvements in fabrication devices such as 3D printers are becoming possible for personal fabrication to freely fabricate any products. To clarify who is liable for the product, the fabricator should keep the fabrication history in an immutable and sustainably accessible manner. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, \"Fabchain,\" that can record the fabrication history in such a manner. By utilizing a scheme that employs a blockchain as an auditable communication channel, Fabchain manages print jobs for the fabricator\u2019s 3D printer over the blockchain, while maintaining a history of a print job. We implemented Fabchain on Ethereum and evaluated the performance for recording a print job. Our results demonstrate that Fabchain can complete communication of a print job sequence in less than 1 minute on the Ethereum test network. We conclude that Fabchain can manage a print job in a reasonable duration for 3D printing, while satisfying the requirements for immutability and sustainability.",

The basic principle of the algorithm is: firstly, select the function that maintains the randomness of the input variables, and then generate a random number for each node participating in the consensus calculation. Then, take these random numbers as variables to calculate the function value, and select a node with the most setting relationship between the random number and the function value as the accounting node. The algorithm realizes the random determination of the accounting node of the blockchain.",

As an important part of the music technology field, the music information retrieval (MIR) technology has emerged in recent years. The MIR field contains dozens of research topics, which can be divided into core layer and application layer according to the closeness of each music element. Blockchain is a frontier technology that uses blockchain data structure to verify and store data, and uses distributed node consensus algorithm to generate and update data. The current development of MIR technology still faces many difficulties, but with the continuous integration of art and technology, it will surely usher in a glorious period of its development.",

        "abstract": "Blockchains have attracted a great deal of attention as a technology for the distributed management of register information at multiple nodes without a centralized system. However, they possess the drawbacks of low transaction throughput and long approval time. These problems can be addressed by shortening the block generation interval; however, shortening this interval alone has the effect of increasing the frequency of forks. In this study, we aim to shorten the block generation interval without increasing the fork generation rate by improving the network topology of the nodes and shortening the propagation time. We propose a neighbor node selection method forming a network topology with a short block propagation time. A blockchain simulator is used to demonstrate the effect of the proposed neighbor node selection method on the propagation delay of the network. This result indicates that the proposed method improves block propagation time.",

        "abstract": "When tracing large (robotically automated) logistics, passive RFID tags are preferred because of their low cost. Therefore, among the many challenges of RFID, security between such a tag and a reader was the main area of research. Yet, the authenticity of data cannot be assured if the service releases falsified information to users either intentionally or by accident. Applying blockchain in supply chains is often referred to and even tested, but it just writes records as instructed, and there is a risk of falsified records being written in the first place. Thus, we propose a design in which a tamper-evident, location-limited, and digitally signing reader writes digital evidence into a blockchain service in an atomic (indivisible) fashion, as they report that a tag is read or written. This allows integrity and confidentiality of the logistics information maintained throughout the system, even if the private keys or signature algorithms are compromised, or the public key certificates expire. To show that our proposal is feasible, we present a prototype design. As a result, the authenticity of logistics information using inexpensive passive tags can be assured. Moreover, this solution can also be applied to IoT (Internet of Things) in general.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the efficiency of music propagation, a music communication model is set based on blockchain technology. The model mainly consists of two kinds of intelligent agents: music propagation environment and music propagation intelligent agent. The attributes of music propagation intelligent agent are mainly divided into the degree of propagation willingness, the probability of propagation, the frequency of propagation and their own ranks. The attributes of music propagation environment are the participation degree of music propagation intelligent agent. The two kinds of intelligent agents realize music communication mainly according to the interactive rules of music information propagation. It is found in the study that the greater the value of music information, the more the number of music propagation agents are; the faster the speed of music information transmission among music propagation intelligent agents becomes, the greater the value of music information is and the more obviously the willingness of the propagation groups rises. In comparison with similar propagation models, the music communication model based on intelligent agent has faster transmission efficiency and higher application value.",

In this regard, this paper proposes an on-chain solution that allows for fine-grained modification (update and erasure) operations on transactions\u2019 (TX) data fields within a BC. The proposed solution is based on a cryptographic primitive called Chameleon Hashing. Via this approach, BC users have the authority to update their data, which are addressed at the TX level with no side effects on the block or chain. By performing and storing data updates, all on-chain traceability and verifiability characteristics of the BC are preserved.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain performance cannot meet the requirement nowadays. One of the crucial ways to improve performance is sharding. However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, cross-contract flexibility, shard availability, and strict transaction atomicity, which are the essential requirements but also the challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving cross-contract flexibility. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. We implement Meepo on the AliCloud, using 32 shards in maximum, achieving more than 120,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is multi-centralized, immutable and traceable, thus is very suitable for distributed storage, privacy and security management in IoTs. However, most existing researches focus on the integration of public blockchain and IoTs. In fact, problems such as slow consensus, low transmission throughput, and completely open storage on the public blockchain are intolerable in IoT scenarios. Although consortium blockchain represented by Hyperledger Fabric has improved the transmission rate, its data security completely relies on the PKI-based certificate mechanism, resulting in transmission inefficiency and privacy leakage. In this paper, a key-derived Controllable Lightweight Secure Certificateless Signature (CLS 2 ) algorithm is proposed to significantly improve the transmission efficiency and keep similar computation overhead of consortium blockchain. Compared with the existing certificateless signatures, CLS 2 achieves more secure transactions, whose controllable anonymity and key-derived mechanism not only prevents public key replacement attacks and forged signature attacks, but also supports hierarchical privacy protection. Armed with CLS 2 , we design a consortium blockchain security architecture based on Hyper-ledger Fabric and edge computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of certificateless signature in consortium blockchain. We formally prove the security of our schemes in the random oracle model. Specifically, the security of the proposed scheme is reduced to the Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Security analysis and experiments in IoT scenarios verify the feasibility and effectiveness of CLS 2 .",

        "abstract": "Today, several solutions for cross-blockchain asset transfers exist. However, these solutions are either tailored to specific assets or neglect finality guarantees that prevent assets from getting lost in transit. In this paper, we present a cross-blockchain asset transfer protocol that supports arbitrary assets and adheres to finality requirements. The ability to freely transfer assets between blockchains may increase transaction throughput and provide developers with more flexibility by allowing them to design digital assets that leverage the capacities and capabilities of multiple blockchains.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology is reshaping fundamental structures in many industries. Similarly, there is an increasing interest in adopting blockchain as a new solution to addressing educational credentialing problems. However, none of the existing blockchain initiatives in educational credentialing seems to meet their original goal of global adoption. Based on the Australian tertiary education credentialing industry, this paper presents an abstract credentialing workflow and involved stakeholders, identifies six practical problems in the industry, and proposes five desired attributes of ideal credentials infrastructure. In addition, the paper presents a layered framework for evaluating seven blockchain-based education projects, and provides insights into factors hindering the wide adoption of these blockchain solutions. Finally, we suggest future considerations for the application development of blockchain-based education solutions.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology that brings transparency in a scalable way for multiple organizations and this is thanks to its several features. There are some exciting blockchain features but among them, decentralization is undoubtedly the most interesting one. Organizations can share data within a distributed ledger. As a consequence, each one can access synchronized data stored in its local Blockchain node. This functionality improves transaction tracking and facilitates access to data within a private group of organizations. However, in some cases, even if organizations accept to share data, they require to hide some private information related to their users or their business model. To tackle privacy and trust issues between organizations, this paper presents a blockchain architecture based on the proxy re-encryption scheme. This scheme is integrated within smart contracts to provide a very efficient, fast, and secure platform. The proposed architecture is implemented in an Hyperledger Blockchain and tested in a real transport and mobility use case.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.",

        "abstract": "Diverse technologies, such as machine learning and big data, have been driving the prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous proliferation of IoT devices. Consequently, it is natural that IoT becomes the driving force to meet the increasing demand for frictionless transactions. To secure transactions in IoT, blockchain is widely deployed since it can remove the necessity of a trusted central authority. However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and financial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target Denial of Service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new committee members auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamir\u2019s secret-sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLB\u2019s resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamoto\u2019s attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms. Extensive evaluation results show the superior resistance against attacks and demonstrate high scalability of BLB compared with current leading paradigms based on PoS and PoW.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, blockchain technology has become one of the key technical innovation fields in the world. From the simple Bitcoin that can only be transferred at first to the blockchain application ecology that is now blooming, blockchain is gradually building a credible internet of value. However, with the continuous development and application of blockchain, even the blockchain based on cryptography is facing a series of network security problems and has caused great property losses to participants. Therefore, studying blockchain security and accelerating standardization of blockchain security have become the top priority to ensure the orderly and healthy development of blockchain technology. This paper briefly introduces the scope of blockchain security from the perspective of network security, sorts out some existing standards related to blockchain security, and gives some suggestions to promote the development and application of blockchain security standardization.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology has positively impacted traceability across various industries such as logistics and shipping. By overcoming the problem of data silos among organizations and concentration of authority, this innovative approach allows a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger to be built. On the other hand, the use of non-fungible tokens, a new concept for projecting digital and physical goods on a blockchain, is expected to be able to represent complicated operations in traceability systems. However, the existing token design lacks an efficient model for retrieval of past histories. The most popular way to retrieve past information on tokens is to use blockchain explorers, which are centralized trusted parties. Otherwise, so far there is only a naive way to examine all block headers, and it takes a vast amount of time. Our preliminary study shows that the processing time for retrieving all histories of 1,030 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet takes approximately 57 minutes. We propose a new token design based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that allows token histories to be efficiently explored without examining the whole blockchain. The model associates each state of the token from past to latest and covers expressions of relationships between tokens, such as merge and split. Our implementation and evaluation reveal that the DAG-based token design significantly improves the efficiency of exploring token transfer histories. The results show that our method can complete the exploration for 1,030 tokens in a matter of seconds and maintains performance over the long term even if the blockchain grows.",

        "abstract": "In many organizations, permissioned blockchain networks are currently transitioning from a proof-of-concept stage to production use. A crucial part of this transition is ensuring awareness of potential threats to network operations. Due to the plethora of software components involved in distributed ledgers, threats may be difficult or impossible to detect without a structured monitoring approach. To this end, we conduct a survey of attacks on permissioned blockchains and develop a set of threat indicators. To gather these indicators, a data processing pipeline is proposed to aggregate log information from relevant blockchain components, enriched with data from external sources. To evaluate the feasibility of monitoring current blockchain frameworks, we determine relevant data sources in Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that the required data is mostly available, but also highlight significant improvement potential with regard to threat intelligence, chaincode scanners and built-in metrics.",

        "abstract": "Since the creation of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, the interest in blockchain technology has increased, entering areas such as loT (Internet of Things) and data sharing. The main objective of this paper is to develop a system that allows the storage of data from loT services in a decentralized network with a blockchain managing transactions through a smart contract. The project was carried out using the blockchain Ethereum, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storage, Solidity language for contract development, NodeJS for coding the simulation of loT devices, web interface and back-end of the solution. The MQTT protocol was used to transport data from the devices. Our main objective was achieved, as the tests carried out show use cases in which this solution has an advantage over the direct storage in the Ethereum blockchain.",

        "abstract": "The growing popularity of Blockchain networks attracts also malicious and hacking users. Effectively detecting inappropriate and malicious activity should thus be a top priority for safeguarding blockchain networks and services. Blockchain behavior analysis can be used to detect unusual account activities or time periods with network-wide irregular properties. Thus, optimized anomaly detection based on historical data is an essential task for securing transactions and services. However, processing the complete blockchain history can be slow and costly due to its large size and rapid growth. In this paper we suggest addressing this challenge by analyzing summarized blocks data structures, called sketches, rather than the entire blockchain. Sketches are common data structures used in computer systems and blockchain networks, to allow compact data representation while supporting efficient executions of particular queries. We study how sketches can be used to detect suspicious accounts or time periods without the need to maintain or go through the entire blockchain data. We design solutions for the major known attacks and conduct experiments to evaluate them based on real Ethereum data. We compare the accuracy, run-time and memory usage of our algorithms with traditional detection algorithms relying on the complete blockchain data. Our results indicate that sketch-based anomaly detection methods can provide a practical scalable solution for detecting anomalies in blockchain networks.",

        "abstract": "At present, the ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) has been widely used in different fields of data sharing such as cross-border paperless trade, digital government and etc. However, there still exist some challenges including single point of failure, key abuse and key unaccountable issues in CP-ABE. To address these problems. We propose an accountable CP-ABE mechanism based on block chain system. First, we establish two authorization agencies MskCA and AttrVN(Attribute verify Network),where the MskCA can realize master key escrow, and the AttrVN manages and validates users' attributes. In this way, our system can avoid the single point of failure and improve the privacy of user attributes and security of keys. Moreover, in order to realize auditability of CP-ABE key parameter transfer, we introduce the did and record parameter transfer process on the block chain. Finally, we theoretically prove the security of our CP-ABE. Through comprehensive comparison, the superiority of CP-ABE is verified. At the same time, our proposed schemes have some properties such as fast decryption and so on.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized finance, i.e., DeFi, has become the most popular type of application on many public blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) in recent years. Compared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security of participantsfunds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to that project but other associated projects as well are collected for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security attacks that are unreported before. A video of BLOCKEYE is available at https://youtu.be/7DjsWBLdlQU.",

        "abstract": "The traditional electronic voting (e-voting) has the problems of dead vote, repetition and missing registration, which cannot reflect the voting result correctly, objectively and fairly. With the booming development of blockchain in recent years, blockchain technology provides a new solution in the field of e-voting. Multi-District election is an important method of election in real life, e.g. in US presidential election. Inspired by the electoral college system, we propose a blockchain-based e-voting scheme for multi-district election. First, we propose a blockchain-based voter registration method that all voters are authenticated by the blockchain system. Second, we design a two-layer blockchain architecture, where the lower layer records the votes of voters in each district and the higher layer records the votes of electors. Then we describe the voting process and evaluate the security and availability of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can satisfy the needs of multi-district election.",

        "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated searchable blockchains that not only provide reliable search over encrypted distributed storage systems but ensure privacy is preserved. Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a single-keyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67% less time delay and 59.96% less financial cost.",

        "abstract": "The General Purpose Atomic Crosschain Transaction (GPACT) protocol allows composable programming across multiple Ethereum blockchains. It allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the whole call graph of function calls is rolled back. The protocol operates on existing Ethereum blockchains without modification. It works for both public and consortium blockchains, and is expected to work across heterogeneous blockchains other than Ethereum. The protocol has been analysed in terms of Gas usage and Finalised Block Periods for writing a value from one blockchain to another.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has attracted lots of attention in recent years. However, the performance of blockchain cannot meet the requirement of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the important bottlenecks of blockchain is the limited computing resources on a single server while executing transactions. To address this issue, we propose Aeolus blockchain to achieve the distributed execution of blockchain transactions. There are two key challenges to achieving this for IoT blockchain: transaction structure and state consistency. Facing these challenges, we first propose a distributed blockchain transaction structure, which imports extra parameters to divide the transaction execution into different stages to enable distributed execution. Second, we propose distributed state update sharding, which equips each blockchain peer with its own master and shard servers. In this way, each blockchain peer can be considered as a cluster that distributes the transaction to shorten the processing time and reach the consensus finally. We implement Aeolus on Go-Ethereum to evaluate its feasibility, on a testbed including 132 cloud servers. Our system runs stably for more than 8 h under the workload of 190 000 000 real-world user transactions. Experimental results show the efficiency that Aeolus can achieve more than 100 000 transactions/s of blockchain transactions, which is 15.6 times the throughput of the original blockchain.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of concepts such as Metaverse and Web 3.0, digital identity plays a very important role as one of its infrastructures. The traditional digital identity model is no longer suitable for the requirements of the digital economy to some extent at this stage. The traditional centralized identity management system has many drawbacks. For example, the owner of the digital identity does not actually control his own identity, and there is a risk of easy disclosure and theft of identity information. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, traceability, etc., which can effectively solve the problems of centralized digital identity. After analyzing and summarizing the evolution trend of digital identity from centralization to decentralization, this paper focuses on the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) based on blockchain. Based on the analysis and comparison of various SSI implementation schemes, the development difficulties of blockchain digital identity are summarized and the future development direction is pointed out.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has gained considerable traction over the last few years and plays a critical role in realizing decentralized and cryptocurrency applications. A challenge that has been over-looked in prior blockchain algorithms is that they do not consider large-scale network outages and relied on the assumption of a reliable global network connectivity. In the event of a large scale network partition, forks may occur between partitioned regions. After the partition ends they will be discarded, leading to the loss of many blocks and a considerable amount of wasted work. This paper presents PeloPartition, which provides a sharding mechanism to improve blockchain's resilience to the possibility of a global internet outage. In PeloPartition we form consensus groups dynamically and consider the partitioning of the group as a hint to split the blockchain into branches and guarantee that all of them will be merged after the network is recovered. We indicate different methodologies to ensure blockchain security while partitioning occurs. Our experiments use simulations to show how this approach can improve the performance of blockchain algorithms and prevent wasted computational power during partitioning.",

        "abstract": "Data sharing is as vital as data storage. Existing centralized data sharing and access systems provide less transparency and traceability as the users have to trust a centralized authority and its decision making for the entire system. There is a need for decentralized distributed data storage and access without a central authority. Blockchain provides promising solutions to such needs. However, the existing decentralized blockchain-based solutions are complex and involve financial incentives, which limits their applications. We propose a secure permissioned blockchain-based decentralized system, VAULT, with a novel quorum-based consensus. We store encrypted files using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and the references to the files in the blockchain. VAULT is designed for applications involving collaboration from multiple permissioned parties, and users can store, access, and share data as well as manage projects through blockchain. Our experimental results show that our quorum selection is fair, and the VAULT protocol is scalable.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology relies on a growing number of globally distributed ledgers known as blockchain. This technology was used for the creation of the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin that allows transactions to be carried out quickly and easily, without the need to use an intermediary \"financial institution\". The information is sent trough the protocols known as: PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake), which must guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. The present work shows the result of a bibliographic review on the evolution of the blockchain, the PoW and PoS protocols; as well as the application of these within the framework of Ecuadorian legislation with emphasis on the evolution of risks of the PoW protocol.",

        "abstract": "We design a Multi-Layer Aggregate Verification (MLAV) solution to improve supply chain management with IoT Blockchain devices. We apply MLAV to IoT Blockchain applications in Agriculture 4.0 to demonstrate the feasibility of our solutions and models. In the current Agriculture 4.0 structure, large companies have successfully applied blockchain solutions and ecosystems for tracking and tracing agricultural produce, achieving transparency, traceability, and digitalization. However, these existing blockchain solutions are not comprehensive. First, the upstream nodes they serve are all large-scale production suppliers, and smallholders are not taken into consideration. In order to solve this problem, we use a multi-layer architecture that serves three purposes: facilitating smallholders in joining the agricultural blockchain as equal-opportunity nodes, uploading of production activity data, and reducing costs (ex. Ethereum gas fee). Second, the majority of IoT blockchains adopt an ID-based signature scheme in IoT devices, which frequently has lower efficiency. In applying aggregate verification, we may effectively increase ID-based verification efficiency while processing large clusters of data transferred by IoT devices. Finally, we design a blockchain management framework using smart contracts to facilitate the financing of upstream producers.",

Blockchain differs from conventional server-based systems in that it is tamper-resistant and highly available. However, the advantages of blockchain also work to the advantage of attackers. There is an area in the blockchain where users can embed arbitrary data via transactions, and prior works have shown that this area can be exploited for botnet C&C communications. In order to analyze what other types of attacks could develop from the contamination of the blockchain, we constructed specific attack scenarios and analyzed the ease of such attacks by conducting demonstrations experiments. We also proposed countermeasures against the attack scenarios and verified the effectiveness of these by conducting demonstration experiments.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo\u2019s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be \u201cThe DAO Attack\u201d in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary\u2019s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has recently enabled large advances in artificial intelligence, but these tend to be highly centralized. The large datasets required are generally proprietary; predictions are often sold on a per-query basis; and published models can quickly become out of date without effort to acquire more data and re-train them. We propose a framework for participants to collaboratively build a dataset and use smart contracts to host a continuously updated model. This model will be shared publicly on a blockchain where it can be free to use for inference. Ideal learning problems include scenarios where a model is used many times for similar input such as personal assistants, playing games, recommender systems, etc. In order to maintain the model's accuracy with respect to some test set we propose both financial and non-financial (gamified) incentive structures for providing good data. A free and open source implementation for the Ethereum blockchain is provided at https://github.com/microsoft/0xDeCA10B.",

        "abstract": "Ride sharing is a centralized trust based system where users trust the service providers for the ride set up, tracking, cancellation, fare calculation etc. Any malicious activity in the centralized server based system or driver or rider destroys the fairness involved in the ride and causes inconvenience to the parties. After the completion of the ride, the drivers are rated by the riders. There are possibilities that, a malicious rider can claim the refund with a fake complain and give the driver poor rating. Current system is not capable of deciding the correctness of the objections raised by either parties and provides a biased outcome of each objections as per the centralized company's marketing strategies. We present BlockV, a blockchain enabled solution to ensure the fairness of the ride. The creation, completion, dissatisfaction or abortion of any ride will be written in the blockchain ledger, hence will be available to all participants in the peer to peer network. This simultaneously ensures the fairness in maintenance of the inbuilt reputation system. We have implemented a prototype in Ethereum private network and KOVAN test network and the analysis is included.",

Efforts are being made to reduce carbon footprint to mitigate such effects. Calculating the carbon footprint of food products is complex and requires the cooperation of all the stakeholders of the food supply chain. A record keeping system for tracking carbon footprint while preserving privacy for the related parties is needed. This paper presents a new implementation of blockchain for tracking of carbon footprint on food production and transportation stages. We designed a system that tracks the carbon footprint of food processing facilities and transportation parties using cluster-based record keeping while preserving their privacy. We implemented the proposed carbon footprint chain and evaluated its throughput and latency under different scenarios. We show that our blockchain implementation is capable of operating with a larger number of nodes without any scalability issues.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we add secure multiparty computation capabilities to the permissioned blockchain architecture of Hyperledger Fabric, and use them to implement the clearing price mechanism for initial public offering (IPO). As with any blockchain, the core property in Fabric is that all peers must see the same ledger, so using confidential data on the ledger is a challenge. To address this challenge we use cryptographic secure multiparty computation (MPC), which requires that we integrate a few new mechanisms into the Fabric architecture. Specifically we need to let the peers access local information such as their respective secret keys, and also send messages to each other while executing smart contracts. We also had to add to Fabric a library that implements the required cryptographic tools, and to make that library accessible from the smart contracts. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this solution by using it to implement the clearing price mechanism for IPOs. We designed an efficient cryptographic protocol for the IPO clearing price mechanism, and used our integrated system to run it on Fabric. Although not fully optimized yet, the performance of the resulting implementation is more than fast enough for this particular application, ranging from 8 to 23 seconds to execute an IPO sale.",

This paper evaluates the performance of the Hyperledger Iroha framework based on three parameters: (a) total requests per seconds (RPS) over time; (b) response times in milliseconds over time; and (c) number of users in the network over time. The results indicate that the integration of Hyperledger Iroha with a major livestock management and trading platform in the UK, can support at least 200 participants with no errors in the network. Additionally, the total requests per second can reach as high as 40.6, and the response times are in the order of a fraction of a second. This research and its results can assist scholars and practitioners regarding selection of an ideal Blockchain framework for their problem setting.",

        "abstract": "With the evolution and proliferation of blockchain, the technology is becoming more prevalent in enterprise software development. Using the already proven DevOps approach in this setting makes sense, as it can accelerate the general pace of software development and delivery, improve software quality, and increase overall productivity. However, there is currently a lack of guidance on a structured DevOps approach and a breakdown of the specifics in the context of blockchain-based software development. Therefore, we combined gray literature and DevOps application studies from pertinent GitHub projects to systematically investigate current practices and solution approaches for an efficient blockchain-oriented DevOps procedure. In this process, we elaborated procedural steps and related activities according to the main stages of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Our research shows that core DevOps concepts and activities are similar to other areas and are entirely possible with already established CI/CD solutions that orchestrate the right tools, with the difference that more rigorous testing and differentiated deployment practices are required due to the inherent immutability of blockchain.",

        "abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains add blocks, and consequently the chain weight, randomly. The blocks added also have a significant network delay owing to their large size. Large delay combined with randomness causes forks that are responsible for many security problems. One can reduce fork occurrences by designing a system with large block intervals and size but this design compromises performance aspects such as confirmation time guarantees. The trade-off between security and performance in PoW blockchain is a well discussed topic in the literature. In this paper, we aim to reduce the conflict between security and performance through our novel concept of Links. Links are small, fast and frequent structures that can be incorporated on any new or existing PoW blockchains. Links help reduce the confirmation time of its underlying blockchain while preserving its consistency security guarantees. Our novel lower-bound growth rate for PoW systems with links in the presence of a general adversary in a partially synchronous network, shows that links provide a more steady chain growth rate than classic PoW systems without links. On a well-established, secure system like Bitcoin, we use the derived growth rate to show that when links are incorporated to Bitcoin, they help reduce its confirmation time from 60 minutes by half to 30 minutes, while retaining the consistency threshold guarantees of the original Bitcoin system. We provide a proof of concept emulation of links in a Bitcoin test bed consisting of 210 nodes having real world latencies between them. We benchmark a system with links against Bitcoin to show links cause negligible network overheads and no compromises on security in terms of orphaned weight due to forks. Our theoretical analyses and experiments can easily be extended to other Nakamoto style PoW systems.",

        "abstract": "In a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, all nodes need to be able to recognize approximately synchronized clocks. A PoS blockchain relies on external clocks, and each node synchronizes its local clock according to an external clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar protocol. However, this external dependence is undesirable because it reduces the autonomy, sustainability and trustless nature of the blockchain. This paper presents a clock synchronization protocol for slot-based PoS blockchains. The proposed protocol estimates the block propagation time to ensure that the synchronization is closer to that of a real-world clock. In addition, the proposed method considers the clock drift and clock adjustment frequency to achieve more accurate synchronization. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can synchronize with a time that is closer to that of a real-world clock and with higher accuracy than existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the demand for global identifiers has rapidly increased since IoT devices are widely used around the world. This indicates that we need to build a scalable and secure identification system. A blockchain is effective to resolve global identifier conflicts and to prove the legitimacy of the identifiers. However, the blockchain replication cost may become a bottleneck when allocation requests increase. Here, we propose a blockchain-based scalable allocation system for a ubiquitous code (ucode), which is a standardized global numerical identifier. In our system, a registrar bundles ucode allocation requests into a single transaction to reduce the replication cost. Based on the blockchain data generated from the transaction, the owner of each ucode space can provide a proof to claim his ownership. The proof mechanism requires registrants to wait for receiving proof data from the registrar. We analyze the trade-off between the waiting time and ucode allocation scalability. We also compare our proposal with the conventional methods and find that the proposed method enables more registrants to claim ucode ownerships.",

        "abstract": "Permissioned blockchains are a promising technology for secure decentralized data management in business-to-business use-cases. In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public blockchains, which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on thousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-to-business use-cases (such as supply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper consensus, and are often deployed in controlled environments with fast networking and low latency. However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural thinking behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in end-to-end latency several orders of magnitude higher than necessary. In this work, we propose a fundamental shift in permissioned blockchain design, eliminating blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion. This results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or forfeiting reliability and security guarantees. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our design, we prototype StreamChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric, and show that it delivers latency two orders of magnitude lower than Fabric, while sustaining similar throughput. This performance makes StreamChain a potential alternative to traditional databases and, thanks to its streaming paradigm, enables further research, for instance, around reducing latency through relying on modern programmable hardware accelerators.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability issue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of the chain of blocks (and of the transactions within each block). However, total order is often overkilling, since important advanced applications of smart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much higher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order (instead of a total order) can be exploited. In this paper, we propose a distributed concurrent data type, called Setchain, which improves scalability significantly. A Setchain implements a grow-only set object whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional blockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest elements added. Therefore, two operations in the same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are ordered by their respective epoch number. We present different Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and report on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results show that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers, since it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total order. Moreover, since the Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying blockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many smart contract solutions with much faster operations than on basic blockchains.",

The measurement method of terminal device security trust still has the problems of high complexity, lack of universality. In this paper, the device fingerprint library of device access network terminal devices is first established through the device fingerprint mixed collection method; Secondly, the software and hardware features of the device fingerprint are used to increase the uniqueness of the device identification, and the multi- dimensional standard metric is used to measure the trustworthiness of the terminal device; Finally, Block chain technology is used to store the fingerprint and standard model of network access terminal equipment on the chain. To improve the security level of network access devices, a device access method considering the trust of terminal devices from multiple perspectives is implemented.",

        "abstract": "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model is an efficient solution that not only solves the problem of the agricultural product's origin but also provides a method to share the market risk between consumers and producers. In the CSA model, consumers order and pay for products in advance. Then, the producers will send packages of fresh products to consumers after a fixed period corresponding to the paid amount. However, the critical weakness of the CSA model is the lack of solutions for both sides to demonstrate the product's quality, which makes consumers unsure about the condition of receiving products. In consequence, consumers become hesitant to order and pay money in advance. In this paper, we will propose a novel solution that allows consumers to track their products through agricultural diaries recorded by farmers every day. The key difference of the proposed solution is to leverage Blockchain technology advantages in authenticating and protecting the integrity of information. Such that, consumers could track all steps in the production process quickly and reliably. Meanwhile, producers can build and increase their enterprise branding by transferring product information transparently and responsibly.",

        "abstract": "Suppose that Alice plans to buy a physical good from Bob over a programmable Blockchain. Alice does not trust Bob, so she is not willing to pay before the good is delivered off-chain. Similarly, Bob does not trust Alice, so he is not willing to deliver the good before getting paid on-chain. Moreover, they are not inclined to use the services of a trusted third-party. Traditionally, such scenarios are handled by game-theoretic escrow smart contracts, such as BitHalo. In this work, we first show that the common method for this problem suffers from a major flaw which can be exploited by Bob in order to extort Alice. We also show that, unlike the case of auctions, this flaw cannot be addressed by a commitment-scheme-based approach. We then provide a much more general result: assuming that the two sides are rational actors and the smart contract language is Turing-complete, there is no escrow smart contract that can facilitate this exchange without either relying on third parties or enabling at least one side to extort the other.**A preprint of this work appeared in [1].",

        "abstract": "Both the number of blockchains and the discovered number of applications of blockchain are ever-increasing. Understanding how different blockchains compare in performance has become more important than ever, yet each blockchian paper uses its own inconsistent standards for performance analysis. There are few mechanisms that may allow for consistent performance analysis among multiple blockchains. This paper details the implementation of the first-ever multi-layer blockchain parameter tuning system: Parameter Space Exploration. Our system is primarily targeted at the performance issue but also takes into consideration power consumption. Multi-layer blockchains use a permissioned blockchain to solve performance deficits. We find that the side chain is the determining factor for the performance of a multi-layer system; our side chain is chosen among a set of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Crash Fault Tolerance (CFT) based consensus algorithms as they are more energy-efficient and have higher performance than their Proof of Work (PoW) counterparts. Our proposed Parameter Space Exploration has two elements: (1) The concept of a parameter space; (2) A side-by-side benchmarking system for balanced comparison among different multi-layer blockchains and consensus algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The difficulty of tracing the process of planting, processing, quality inspection, storage, transportation and sales of precious Chinese herbal medicines can be well solved by using the blockchain that is characterized by decentralization, tamper resistance and distributed storage. In this paper, we discuss how to design a traceability system for rare Chinese herbal medicine with double-chain structure by using the high efficiency of private blockchain and the extensibility of consortium blockchain to store the detailed information of each process in the interplanetary file system (IPFS), store the Hash value of each production process traceability information in the private blockchain, and record the transaction identification ID in the private blockchain in the previous stage in the traceability information in the next stage, so that consumers can get the complete traceability information of rare Chinese herbal medicines by combining the traceability information of the sales stage with the IPFS. By linking the Hash value of the traceability information of the final sales stage to the consortium blockchain as a transaction, the safety and reliability of the scheme are enhanced. The private blockchain is used to collect and track the traceability information, while the consortium blockchain is to tamper with and verify the traceability information.",

        "abstract": "In the past few years, cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications has been one of the most rapidly emerging fields of computer science, leading to a strong demand of software applications. Several new projects have been emerging almost daily, with an impetus that was not seen since the days of the dawn of the Internet. However, the need of being timely on the market and the lack of experience in a brand new field led to epic disasters, such as those of DAO in 2016 and of Parity Ethereum wallet in 2017. Also, there have been several hacks successfully performed on cryptocurrency exchanges, the biggest being those of MtGox in 2014 (350 million US\n),Bitfinexin2016(72millionUS\n), and Coincheck in 2017 (400 million US$). The application of sound SE practices to Blockchain software development, both for Smart Contract and generic Blockchain software, might be crucial to the success of this new field. Here the issues are the need for specific analysis and design methods, quality control through testing and metrics, security assessment and overall development process. At the same time, Blockchain development offers new opportunities, such as the certification of empirical data used for experiment; the ability to design processes where developers are paid upon completion of their tasks through Blockchain tokens, after acceptance tests performed using Smart Contracts; and more sound techniques enabling pay-per-use software, again using tokens.",

        "abstract": "As data marketplaces are becoming common place, it is also becoming clear that data streams generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices hold value for potential third party consumers. We envision a marketplace for IoT data streams that can unlock such potential value in a scalable way, by enabling any pairs of data providers and consumers to engage in data exchange transactions without any prior assumption of mutual trust. We present a marketplace model and architecture to support trading of streaming data, from the advertising of data assets to the stipulation of legally binding trading agreements, to their fulfilment and payment settlement. Crucially, we show that by using blockchain technology and Smart Contracts in particular, we can offer participants a trade-off between the cost of transactional data exchange, and the risk of data loss when trading with untrusted third parties. We experimentally assess such trade-offs on a testbed using Ethereum Smart Contracts.",

        "abstract": "Employment and workforce industry become more important because the human capital value is linked to the company's profitability. Company becomes employee-centric in the 21st century. To hire an appropriate employee, and reduce hiring liability workplace violence, background screening marketing growth quickly. However, in the human resource industry, background check still is a pain point, especially for employment, education, and skill verification. The traditional background check is prolonged and inaccurate. For overseas recruitment, background check will be more troublesome. This paper comprehensively addresses the challenge of the education, employment and skill verification problem. We propose an innovation E^2 C-Chain which is a two-stage blockchain based education, employment and skill certification system. In the first stage, the new blocks are created when a trust organization verifies the education and employment information of the employee. In the second stage, to encourage the verifiers to participate in the skill verification process, we employ a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) game based incentive mechanism to find the Nash Equilibrium and ensure social cost minimization. We also present the theoretical proofs and extensive simulations to demonstrate beneficial properties and efficiency of our proposed system.",

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoTs), their devices have been collecting our personal data to enhance our life styles and their purposes. Care must be taken when handling such sensitive data to protect the data owners' privacy while guaranteeing the integrity when the data is accessed by a third party. Furthermore, data should be available without much delay to support medical emergencies. Unfortunately, IoT devices may be limited with storage and computational resources to operate highly secure operations and respond to data requests. In this paper, we propose SSP, a novel mechanism that protects the privacy and integrity of the data collected by IoT devices without having a single point of failure, while minimizing the cryptographic operations that must be performed on IoT devices. SSP utilizes the blockchain data structure for availability and integrity, and Multi-Party-Computations (MPC) for privacy protection. We implemented SSP in C/C++ and according to our evaluation results, SSP is efficient in computation, communication, and storage operations on IoT devices.",

Although there are many researches worked on various time-lock systems, they may have some shortcomings like uncertainty in decryption time, not fully decentralized, hard to estimate the required computing resources. In this paper, we proposed a protocol and a reliable encryption scheme to make time-sensitive message be opened on time at a fully decentralized environment, which is then integrated with the blockchain to adapt to different computing power situations. The method also provides the capability of incorporating with appropriate incentives for encouraging participants to contribute their computing resources, which makes our system more suitable for real world applications.",

        "abstract": "Public service organisations (PSOs) have a need to collaborate with each other in order to provide a seamless user experience, mitigate fraud and increase operational efficiency at a reduced tax payer's cost. However, legacy systems built over decades using different technology stacks, make collaboration challenging and hinder efficiency. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have been proposed as a trust and efficiency mechanism for several inter organisation collaborative tasks. They can reduce friction in operations and help achieve a more streamlined and unified public service infrastructure. However, most of the work are either based on theory or purely conceptual and lack implementation. In this paper, we elaborate on the design and implementation of a proof of concept (POC) of a blockchain based interoperability and data sharing system that allows PSOs to seamlessly collaborate and share information in real time. The POC is based on the Registration of Overseas Entities and Beneficial Owners (ROEBO) legislation in the UK and demonstrates interactions between Companies House UK and other PSOs in a hybrid blockchain setting.",

        "abstract": "The fast digital transformation the world experienced in the past few decades has created a multitude of information resources distributed over the Internet and accessed by many different entities. The sharing of these resources needs to be secure and trustworthy to protect the privacy of data and data providers. Privacy and reliability are major concerns especially in blockchain-based data storage systems, as data are held by different owners. Each data provider tries to increase its share of profit by collaborating with other data providers. To ensure secure data sharing in such a decentralized environment, authentication and verification of shared data is needed. This paper proposes a mutual authentication mechanism based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) using hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) to provide anonymity and integrity during the communication process in blockchain-based data sharing. To evaluate the fairness of profit sharing based on data providers' contributions and data utility, we propose the use of the Shapley value techniques. The performed security analysis demonstrates that our proposed approach is resilient against replay, secret disclosure, and traceability attacks.",

        "abstract": "As Multi-Agent Systems, Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) require mechanisms for the allocation of tasks to multiple agents such as workstations or mobile robots. One approach is market-based task allocation (TA) which faces challenges related to fraud and intransparency. Integrating blockchain technology (BCT) into TA enables transparency and tamper resistance. It also allows for the downstream integration of financial transactions in CPPS. This paper proposes a method for two-stage market-based TA in CPPS enabled by BCT. A formal definition for a reverse first-price-sealed-bid auction including the payment process is presented for the blockchain-based two-stage auctioning in a CPPS. The proposed method is implemented in a prototype and tested with a focus on scalability. Transaction times and costs are considered within the experiments. The evaluation reveals that the proposed process is functionable and that financial transactions can be completely automated within CPPS. The time and gas usage of transactions scale in most scenarios and only take a few seconds for completion.",

        "abstract": "Multi-factor challenge-set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFFSIA) is an important part for establishing trust between systems, devices, organizations and humans for the emerging machine-to-everything (M2X) economy. Most systems for identity authentication (IA) are single sign-on (SSO), or have fixed challenge sets of limited degree. Additionally, IA systems are controlled by governments, or corporations that are closely affiliated with government entities. The available systems for self-sovereign IA do not offer the necessary flexible configurability of challenge sets. Based on research publications about a formal MFSSIA protocol, this paper presents a blockchain employing implementation for a running case assuming different smart-contract blockchain systems must be connected for sensitive data exchange. The prototype offers a marketplace for challenge-set creation and the challenge/response-lifecycle management employs decentralized knowledge graphs (DKG) together with oracles for response evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Trust is key to the efficient functioning of any fiat or crypto-currency and so is for the consensus algorithm behind the functioning of blockchain systems. By an arbitrary design choice, Bitcoin and most Proof-of- Work (PoW) blockchains have a limited supply. Once block rewards vanish, only transaction fees will remain as an incentive for miners to partake in the verification process. In this paper, we analyse the impact that miners bargaining over block composition has on consensus in the absence of block rewards: in this situation, competing blocks at the same height may be more attractive to peers by including less transactions (i.e. sharing the mempool). The mining and acceptance of blocks can be modelled as an Ulti-matum Game, where miners' strategies represent their fairness sentiment. Extending previous Literature, our study focuses on the effect of the transaction arrival rate on global consensus in the system and whether local consensus is formed under certain assumptions about the strategies of miners. We find that consensus is threatened when the supply of transactions is low and stable consensus only emerges when the amount of unconfirmed transactions remains sufficient. In addition, when miners are set with randomised strategies, it is more difficult for the system to achieve consensus. Our research suggests that transitioning from a block reward incentive to a transaction fee incentive may weaken and even destroy the consensus of PoW-based systems.",

        "abstract": "In recent years there have been increased efforts to make supply chains transparent and traceable to better protect the end consumer's interests against counterfeiting, contamination, false claims, and inadequate processes. The actors in the supply chain can also leverage additional visibility to proactively tune their operations in response to upstream or downstream disruptions. Blockchain technology, with its promise of immutability, transparency, and provenance is a natural fit to supply chain problems. Several works have discussed the improved design of supply chains leveraging blockchain technology. There have been attempts to address some of the privacy concerns of participants on the blockchain network by using encryption schemes to hide confidential data and group signatures to hide the participant identities. But these do not handle the complexities of the supply chain, where items are constantly packaged, repackaged, and transformed before reaching the end consumer. Our work presents a blockchain-based model for the supply chain that provides privacy and traceability with efficient contamination tracing while accounting for the aforementioned complexities of the supply chain operations. The last property enables an end consumer to be convinced about a product to be unaffected by identified faulty upstream processes (contamination) without access to the entire history of the product. Our solution makes novel use of cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic accumulators to provide these guarantees. The choice of the cryptographic components is grounded in concrete efficiency, and we present an experimental evaluation of the implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric, a popular platform for enterprise blockchains.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology has been applied to various applications (e.g., smart buildings and smart cities) that typically run in an environment of smart devices, known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). To support these applications, different blockchain architectures, data structures and consensus algorithms have been proposed, tailored to IoT. One such proposal, appendable-block blockchain, is a promising blockchain framework for use in IoT environments. It provides a scalable data structure that allows parallel insertions between independent nodes. However, it has some limitations, in particular related to the possible eclipse attack by malicious gateways and the lack of consensus for transactions insertion. To solve these issues, we propose a new consensus mechanism for appendable-block blockchains, called context-based consensus. Using context-based consensus, information can be inserted in parallel across devices (called context) while ensuring that light-weight consensus is performed to guarantee that a transaction is well-formed and it is placed in the correct order. We implemented context-based consensus and show that using multiple contexts reduces latency and increases the throughput of transaction insertions when compared to consensus without contexts or using single transaction consensus.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain networks are mainly used in financial verification processes, the most famous of which is the Bitcoin network consisting of a huge number of nodes. Expansion of blockchain technology, however, to other areas, such as healthcare, arts, culture, and entertainment, is being considered internationally. Especially important challenges for ensuring the reliability of blockchain networks and the security of peer-to-peer networks are shortening the block propagation times throughout a blockchain network to reduce fork and preventing malicious eclipse attacks against targeted nodes in a network. Previous methods have tried to increase the block propagation speed at the expense of imposing a higher burden on each node and a higher risk of eclipse attack. This paper proposes a new neighbor selection method based on the neighbor's regional information. That is, each node has a relatively small number neighbors located outside its region. By using this simple method, the distribution of blocks throughout the network becomes faster and the random neighbor selection nature in a blockchain network is kept intact; thus, risk of eclipse attack is low.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain-based applications have been recently introduced in communication networks. Different applications require different levels of service whereas existing blockchain-based applications mostly provide a single class of service. In this paper, we propose a multi-class blockchain services (MCBS) framework that prioritizes the processing of time-critical blockchain-based applications in communication networks. We model MCBS as a queueing system and derive the average service times for the different classes. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously optimize the average service time and aggregate transactions arrival rate. The numerical results show that existing blockchains may not satisfy the requirements of time-critical applications whereas a high priority queue in MCBS may meet the requirement. In addition, we analyze MCBS under double-spend attacks and show that with maximum attacker hash power, the blockchain system can still be stable if the aggregate transaction arrival rate is lower than half of its maximum achievable value.",

Blockchain characteristics have been rapidly recognized as a turning point in many use case scenarios beyond the financial sector. Conversely, there is still a significant incongruity regarding how the blockchain\u2019s unique characteristics can be mapped to the elicited non-functional requirements (NFRs) of blockchain-based systems. Motivated by exploring the potential categories of NFRs that dominate the landscape of blockchain-based systems, we conducted an inductive content analysis on a sample of extracted requirements from 7 different blockchain-based projects developed by two startup firms. This paper presents the initial view of the constructed mapping between the blockchain characteristics on one side and the dominating NFRs for the blockchain-based system.",

        "abstract": "Telecom operators are deploying the fifth generation (5G) networks around the world which promises high information transmission rate, wide network coverage, low communication delay, and easy access to a large number of devices. However, during the construction and operation of 5G, telecom operators face many challenges, such as insufficient frequency resources, low efficiency of network management, information opacity, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Blockchain is a distributed system maintained by multiple parties with inherit features including decentralization, traceability and tamperproof. These features collectively contribute to a new application ecosystem where transactions are secure and trustworthy. Therefore, blockchain is expected to integrate with 5G networks to build safer and more reliable mobile network infrastructures. This paper firstly discusses the merits of blockchain technology and the benefits of integrating it with 5G networks. Then a variety of applications of blockchain technology in telecom network operation are reviewed, including spectrum sharing, international roaming settlement, network operation management, number selection management and supply chain management. In the end, we show our recently advance in integrating blockchain in 5G by introducing a multi framework based blockchain service network architecture deployed in real environment.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that has gained a lot of visibility in recent years due to its characteristics of transparency and immutability. Many studies have been carried out in order to use this technology in the financial industry, but there are still issues regarding scalability that need to be resolved before the technology can be used. In the literature there are works that perform Blockchain performance analysis of the private model, making comparisons between different platforms. However, no work was found regarding the analysis of the impact that changing parameters has on the performance of private model Blockchain applications. In this context, this article introduces PriBB that contributes to the literature regarding the proposal of a benchmark to evaluate the performance of private model Blockchain applications. In particular, it focuses on the impact that the parameters of block size and interval between blocks have on the performance of applications, since no equivalent work has been found in the literature. The PriBB was evaluated in a real data center environment and aims to assist in the optimization of parameterization of Blockchain applications of the private model. The results are promising and demonstrate that a given parameter can impact more than 100 times the performance in running Blockchain applications.",

        "abstract": "The blockchain-enabled internet of medical things (IoMT) is an emerging paradigm that could provide strong trust establishment and ensure the traceability of data sharing in the IoMT networks. One of the fundamental building blocks for Blockchain is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nevertheless, when processing a large number of transactions, the verification of multiple signatures will incur cumbersome overhead to the nodes in Blockchain. Although batch verification is able to provide a promising approach that verifies multiple signatures simultaneously and efficiently, the upper bound of batch size is limited to small-scale and the efficiency will drop rapidly as the batch size grows in the state-of-the-art ECDSA batch schemes. Meanwhile, most of the existing researches only focus on improving the efficiency of batch verification algorithms in various cryptosystem while ignoring the identification of invalid signatures, which could cause severe performance degradation when the batch verification fails. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an efficient and large-scale batch verification scheme with group testing technology based on ECDSA. The application of the presented protocols in Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric has been analyzed as supportive and effective. When the batch verification returns a false result, we utilize group testing technology to improve the efficiency of identifying invalid signatures. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol outperforms the related ECDSA batch verification schemes.",

        "abstract": "Permissioned Blockchain systems rely mainly on Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols to establish consensus on the order of transactions. While Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols mostly guarantee consistency (safety) in an asynchronous network using 3f+1 machines to overcome the simultaneous malicious failure of any f nodes, in many systems, e.g., blockchain systems, the number of available nodes (resources) is much more than 3f + 1. To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Since more than one cluster is involved in each cross-shard transaction, the ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph.",

Blockchain technology along with incentive and penalty mechanisms have been suggested to counter these. In this paper, we explore verifiable off-chain computations using zero-knowledge proofs as an alternative to incentive and penalty mechanisms in blockchain-based federated learning. In our solution, learning nodes, in addition to their computational duties, act as off-chain provers submitting proofs to attest computational correctness of param-eters that can be verified on the blockchain. We demonstrate and evaluate our solution through a health monitoring use case and proof-of-concept implementation leveraging the ZoKrates language and tools for smart contract-based on-chain model management. Our research introduces verifiability of correctness of learning processes, thus advancing blockchain-based federated learning.",

        "abstract": "Attacks targeting several millions of non-internet based application users are on the rise. These applications such as SMS and USSD typically do not benefit from existing multi-factor authentication methods due to the nature of their interaction interfaces and mode of operations. To address this problem, we propose an approach that augments blockchain with multi-factor authentication based on evidence from blockchain transactions combined with risk analysis. A profile of how a user performs transactions is built overtime and is used to analyse the risk level of each new transaction. If a transaction is flagged as high risk, we generate n-factor layers of authentication using past endorsed blockchain transactions. A demonstration of how we used the proposed approach to authenticate critical financial transactions in a blockchain-based asset financing platform is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "One of the backbone technology of Blockchains is cryptography. In simpler terms cryptography is the mathematical art of secret writing, however it's applications are not limited to writing secret codes only. Essentially cryptography is used to achieve three main security goals namely confidentiality (in-formation must be hidden from the unintended users), integrity (information must be prevented from illicit modifications) and availability (information must be readily available to intended users at all times). In cryptography confidentiality is achieved by employing a technique called as Encryption, integrity is achieved by employing special one way functions called as Cryptographic Hash Functions and authentication (process for verifying identity of the sender) is achieved by employing a technique called as Digital Signatures. For better understanding about the working of Blockchain it is essential to understand cryptographic concepts on which Blockchain is built. This paper presents the brief overview of such cryptographic concepts. In particular this papers throws light on the cryptographic concepts used to build Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains. Furthermore this paper also throws light on the need and requirements of post-quantum cryptographic primitives for post-quantum Blockchains.",

        "abstract": "A blockchain is the platform for cryptocurrencies and is the \u201cenabler\u201d for Bitcoin; Bitcoin is the application (cryptocurrency) that is being \u201cenabled.\u201d This chapter aims to break down blockchain technology for a sales\u2010driven and technically focused audience. It discusses the technical merits of blockchain technology in a simple manner with direct correlations to how it applies to business. The primary solution that blockchain technologies really provide as compared to a traditional database is around the distribution of trust. The nodes in the blockchain network in permissionless (enterprise) blockchains have a copy of the whole blockchain. The principles of blockchain have renewed trust in users in an era of digital economics and intrinsically fair social systems. For enterprises, the blockchain disruption will take place because it provides capabilities around compliance, cost efficiencies, or even transparent transactions for the customer base. The chapter covers blockchain types and deployment concerns and also compares blockchains to cloud computing services.",

Blockchains are used in two main categories of IT solutions, either public permissionless or private enterprise permissioned blockchains. The chapter covers enterprise blockchain integration, scalability, and security. The structure and the components of the blockchain network will be different and will vary between blockchain solutions. When it comes to architecting solutions for blockchains for an enterprise, it is important to understand how enterprise architectures have been approached. Having a workflow can certainly provide significant instructions to help facilitate the design of a blockchain solution. Blockchain technology has the core characteristics of decentralization, accountability, and security. These characteristics are important to understand when designing a blockchain service. The chapter highlights specifics as to how four blockchain ledgers address the data structure in more detail. They are Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, Ethereum, and Quorum.",

        "abstract": "With the advancement of blockchain technology at a breakneck pace, numerous organizations are now experimenting with blockchain solutions for their operations. In this nascent stage, due to the scarcity of blockchain domain experts, there is a growing trend towards an automated conversion of legacy systems to blockchain-based systems. To this aim, this paper presents an automated framework that facilitates the migration of centralized Java-based applications to decentralized Solidity-based Ethereum applications. The experimental results are encouraging, demonstrating its ability to handle large-scale Java codebase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of its kind that enables the translation of Java source codes to Solidity source codes.",

Yet, artists remain at the mercy of centralized platforms that control content listing and advertisement, with little transparency and fairness in terms of number of views or revenue. On the other hand, consumers are distanced from the publishers and cannot authenticate originality of the content. In this paper, we develop a reliable and fair platform for content sharing without a central facilitator. The platform is built as a decentralized data storage layer to store and share content in a fault-tolerant manner, where the peers also participate in a blockchain network. The blockchain is used to manage content listings and as an auditable and fair marketplace transaction processor that automatically pays out the content creators and the storage facilitators using smart contracts. We demonstrate the system with the blockchain layer built on Hyperledger Fabric and the data layer built on Tahoe-LAFS, and show that our design is practical and scalable with low overheads.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized finance has grown up dramatically in recent years, covering various cryptocurrency or blockchain financial applications. With the support of blockchain technology, people have shown great enthusiasm and trust in decentralized financial services. However, due to sharing personal information with other institutions, users' privacy and data security will be difficult to be guaranteed. Moreover, various encryption methods such as homomorphic encryption focus on protecting the data stored on the blockchain, but few enhance client-side data security. Motivated by this condition, we develop an image-based privacy-preserving scheme to store users' financial service data as images. Transferring the numerical service data into images ensures that users can comprehend the content and prevent data recognized by the machine. We evaluate our scheme through conducting numerical evaluations from image attack effectiveness and smart contract functions' efficiency analysis.",

        "abstract": "Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines specifies a \u2018travel rule\u2019 to prevent illegal usages of virtual assets such as money laundering. Following the travel rule, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) should exchange personal identity information of originator and beneficiary when transferring virtual assets. In this paper, we propose CODE, a novel decentralized blockchain-based travel rule compliance system. Since blockchain does not need any third party, it can eliminate the possibility of massive data leakage due to centralization. It also ensures secure management of travel rule data. We developed a system that uses Corda as a blockchain platform. According to the characteristics of Corda, data are only shared between related parties. Our system also provides an address-search method to verify the beneficiary's identity in real-time. An originator requests virtual asset transfer using only the beneficiary's virtual asset address. By joining the Corda network and installing the proposed system developed in the form of a CorDapp, any VASP can easily use this system to exchange travel rule data.",

        "abstract": "Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have long been criticized for their high computational and storage overhead. Unfortunately, while a number of proposals address the energy consumption of existing Proof-of-Work deployments, little attention has been given so far to remedy the storage overhead incurred by those blockchains. In fact, it seems widely acceptable that full nodes supporting the blockchains have to volunteer hundreds of GBs of their storage, to store and verify all transactions exchanged in the system. In this paper, we explore the solution space to effectively reduce the storage footprint of Proof-of-Work based blockchains. To do so, we analyze, by means of thorough empirical measurements, how existing full blockchain nodes utilize data from the shared ledger to validate incoming transactions/blocks. Based on this analysis, we show that it is possible for full nodes to locally reduce their storage footprint to approximately 15 GB, without any modification to the underlying protocol. We also discuss other client-side strategies to further reduce the storage footprint while incurring negligible computational overhead on the nodes.",

The immutability, however, also introduces threats and challenges with respect to privacy laws and illegal content. Introducing a certain degree of mutability, which enables the possibility to store and remove information, can therefore increase the opportunities for blockchains. In this paper, we present a concept for a mutable blockchain structure. Our approach enables the removal of certain blocks, while maintaining the blockchain's verifiability property. Since our concept is agnostic to any consensus algorithms, it can be implemented with permissioned and permissionless blockchains.",

It will assist to know the overall count of the candidates who participated and it functions in the same way as people's faith in their governments does. Blockchain technology is the one that handles the actual vote. We use the secure hash algorithm for resolving this problem and tried to bring a solution through the usage of this booming technology.

The multiple SDP controllers form a blockchain network, and they are responsible for implementing the host authentication and authorization. The authorization policies are defined by the accepting SDP hosts. The policy can be recorded into the ledger, and then the authorization is implemented by the SDP controllers in the blockchain. The policy can also be kept by the accepting SDP host because of the privacy preserving, and then the authorization is implemented by the accepting SDP hosts themselves. The blockchain oracles are introduced to support multiple authentication methods defined in SDP.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) bears unprecedented security and scalability challenges due to the magnitude of data produced and exchanged by IoT devices and platforms. Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchain-backed IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a \"data marketplace\" by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing \"by design\" remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.",

        "abstract": "Popular permissionless distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems using proof-of-work (PoW) for Sybil attack resistance have extreme energy requirements, drawing stern criticism from academia, business and the media. DLT systems building on alternative consensus mechanisms, particularly proof-of-stake (PoS), aim to address this downside. In this paper, we take an initial step towards comparing the energy requirements of such systems to understand whether they achieve this goal equally well. While multiple studies have analysed the energy demands of individual blockchains, little comparative work has been done. We approach this research gap by formalising a basic consumption model for PoS blockchains. Applying this model to six archetypal blockchains generates three main findings. First, we confirm the concerns around the energy footprint of PoW by showing that Bitcoin's energy consumption exceeds the energy consumption of all PoS-based systems analysed by at least three orders of magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are significant differences in energy consumption among the PoS-based systems analysed, with permissionless systems having a larger energy footprint overall owing to their higher replication factor. Third, we point out that the type of hardware that validators use has a considerable impact on whether the energy consumption of PoS blockchains is comparable with or considerably larger than that of centralised systems.",

Therefore, a monitoring system for transactions occurring on the blockchain is needed. This paper proposes a monitoring system and an explorer to show the results collected from the system.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology on the platform business becomes a new paradigm which gets security, irreversibility, and trustfulness closer to both of clients and service providers (SPs) for providing a better quality of service. To provide an economic analysis of such blockchain-based platform business, a game theoretic approach is used to model a competitive market against the incumbent platform operated by a centralizer as a trusted third party. In this market, the platforms behave as a mediator to deliver the services provided by SPs to clients. The crucial factors for the success of blockchain-based platform business are (i) how SPs' participation is reflected on its quality of service (QoS) and (ii) how to incentivize SPs to contribute their resources such as computing/storage infrastructure. In our game formulation, a non-cooperative two-stage dynamic game is used, where the first stage models how to incentivize SPs in a blockchain-based platform and the second stage models the competition between platforms to attract clients. As a result, we provide an equilibrium analysis, which gives a useful insight into how much the service quality of blockchain-based platform affects the competition between platforms and the equilibrium incentive strategy for SPs. Moreover, our numerical analysis shows that the equilibrium incentive increases with proportional to the QoS of a blockchain-based platform whereas the incentive becomes negative if it provides a non-increasing QoS with the number of participated SPs.",

This paper makes a deep research on the blockchain technology of digital copyright. With the help of self-supervision, traceability and decentralization of blockchain technology, as well as the Map function, we can improve the data transmission rate in the multi-channel model and obtain accurate time complexity values. Hence the probability of all kinds of digital copyright infringement events is greatly reduced.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Internet of Things (IoT) aims to enable a world where physical objects, integrated into information networks, provide smart services for human beings. The introduction of edge computing in IoT can reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and extend the cloud services to be distributed at the edge of the network. However, edge-based IoT systems currently faces challenges in their decentralized trust management. Trust management plays an essential role for reliable data fusion and mining, provisioning of services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. In this talk, we analyze the edge-based IoT architectures that are available in the literature. Then, a comprehensive review of trust requirements in edge-enabled IoT systems is presented. We notably discuss about blockchain as a key enabler to address many trust related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and edge computing. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of trusted edge computing based IoT systems' performance and recommend promising research directions for future investigations.",

This paper studies the problem of storing tree-structured provenance records with linkages in blockchain while keeping the linkages private. We present Prv 2 chain, a framework that allows users to privately store their linked provenance records while protecting the records and their linkages. Users are also allowed to perform on-chain tree traversal efficiently. These are enabled by our novel record ID generation algorithms. Our experiments indicate the extra overhead incurred by Prv 2 chain is little enough for practical deployment.",

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that in most cases should be immutable\u2014that is, the information (transactions) that is written to the ledger cannot be modified or deleted. The chapter covers many of the vulnerabilities in the threat landscape that a blockchain network could be exposed to, including distributed denial\u2010of\u2010service attacks and 51% attacks. In Ethereum blockchains, all modifications to a smart contract's data must be performed by its blockchain code. Security is built into the blockchain code and the smart contract platform. The chapter reviews the blockchain\u2010specific features for Ethereum, Hyperledger, Quorum, and Corda. Ethereum, Hyperledger, Corda, and Quorum all offer unique security and privacy features and capacity that should be considered in IT Administrator blockchain design and deployments.",

R3 is an enterprise blockchain software firm developed by a broad ecosystem of more than 200 members and partners across multiple industries from both the private and public sectors. Quorum is an open source blockchain solution built by enhancing the existing Ethereum blockchain. Enterprise blockchains have different requirements than public blockchains such as Ethereum. Ethereum uses a virtual machine to deploy the blockchain services. The chapter also covers the technical merits including security, consensus, virtual machines, features, and functions that are critical to understanding the blockchain platform.

        "abstract": "The fast development of Blockchain technology makes it widely applied in several fields of digital transactions, like e-government affairs and the protection of financial transactions. In this article, we propose a homomorphic encryption-based Blockchain for circuit copyright protection that effectively addresses the issues in the protection of circuit copyright transactions, such as low security of private data, low efficiency in transaction data storage, cooperation and supervision. First, we establish a homomorphic encryption-based mathematical model by utilizing Blockchain and intelligent contract, and next, the algorithms that include Blockchain generation, homomorphic chain encryption/decryption, and intelligent contract are designed. As the intelligent contract is correctly executed in Blockchain, a fully homomorphic encryption-based identity authentication protocol is tackled for Blockchain, given that it ensures the change operation of any third-party in Blockchain and realizes real-time verification. The system is apposite for circuit copyright protection in a blockchain network, due to the use of distributed identity authentication and real-time extensible storage improves the security and extensibility of blockchain-based circuit copyright protection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has reduced the transmission cost and improved the efficiency of data storage and supervision. In addition, it is resilient to several common attacks (e.g., double-spending attacks), yet incurs low cost/overhead and has a higher level of security when compared to three other competing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "As blockchain technologies mature and ecosystems over blockchain evolve, peers on blockchain networks often face situations in which they need to conduct voting for decision-making; as happened in the case of the DAO hard fork event on Ethereum. However, a natively built-in voting mechanism is not available on any of the existing blockchain platforms. Thus, the decision making either is delegated to a few network members who make such decisions offline or is dependent on third party online voting services. In both cases, peers directly or indirectly rely on trusted parties or centralized systems. This is against the basic decentralization principle of blockchain and exposes the election to frauds. To facilitate decision-making in a decentralized and secure manner, we propose a native blockchain voting protocol for peers to vote over their existing blockchain network without the need of any trusted or third party. Our protocol preserves end-to-end privacy and possesses desirable properties such as detectability and correctability against cheating. A reference implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric that demonstrates the validity and practical applicability of our protocol is also provided.",

        "abstract": "A key aspect of Federated Learning (FL) is the requirement of a centralized aggregator to maintain and update the global model. However, in many cases orchestrating a centralized aggregator might be infeasible due to numerous operational constraints. In this paper, we introduce BAFFLE, an aggregator free, blockchain driven, FL environment that is inherently decentralized. BAFFLE leverages Smart Contracts (SC) to coordinate the round delineation, model aggregation and update tasks in FL. BAFFLE boosts computational performance by decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks followed by a score and bid strategy. In order to characterize the performance of BAFFLE, we conduct experiments on a private Ethereum network and use the centralized and aggregator driven methods as our benchmark. We show that BAFFLE significantly reduces the gas costs for FL on the blockchain as compared to a direct adaptation of the aggregator based method. Our results also show that BAFFLE achieves high scalability and computational efficiency while delivering similar accuracy as the benchmark methods.",

        "abstract": "The growth of IoT devices during the last decade has led to the development of smart ecosystems, such as smart homes, prone to cyberattacks. Traditional security methodologies support to some extend the requirement for preserving privacy and security of such deployments, but their centralized nature in conjunction with low computational capabilities of smart home gateways make such approaches not efficient. Last achievements on blockchain technologies allowed the use of such decentralized architectures to support cybersecurity defence mechanisms. In this work, a blockchain framework is presented to support the cybersecurity mechanisms of smart homes installations, focusing on the immutability of users and devices that constitute such environments. The proposed methodology provides also the appropriate smart contracts support for ensuring the integrity of the smart home gateway and IoT devices, as well as the dynamic and immutable management of blocked malicious IPs. The framework has been deployed on a real smart home environment demonstrating its applicability and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "We use blockchain technology to tackle the problem of securing periodic double auctions for financial \u2018dark pool\u2019 trading, such that the privacy of pre-trade order information is preserved and the behaviour of the auction operator can be verified. A smart contract is used as a public audit trail without revealing the order intention of traders. Auction matching is performed off-chain, allowing alternative auction mechanisms to be used without altering the smart contract code. A full system implementation is deployed on the Harmony blockchain, and comparative evaluation of the protocol demonstrates some clear advantages over the closest published alternative.",

To facilitate issuing and verifying certificates globally, the framework is lightweight on the user's side. The essential certification operations, issuing certificate, verifying certificate, and verifying vaccine, are implemented preserving user's privacy. Our framework's smart contracts design is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain test network to support indexing and querying the certification data. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the performance of the primary functionalities. The results show the retrieving time of certificate information is efficient no matter how long the chain is, compared with scanning the blocks to find the target data.",

        "abstract": "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted and changed our daily routines. Worldwide, people have had to adapt by undergoing remote work and self-quarantine. This situation has required transforming strategies for various logistics services for a variety of service providers, such as retail stores and restaurants. The concept of contactless delivery has emerged to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. However, contactless delivery only reduces the direct interaction between the delivery personnel and the customer. In addition to peer-to-peer contact, items still go through insecure interactions between and among the delivery personnel and other unknown third parties. Even if the items are delivered without physical contact, concerns remain about their routes in the supply chain. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based framework to enable the traceability of products in the supply chain. This framework records and tracks delivery traces and the medical status of delivery personnel in a privacy-preserved manner, ultimately contributing to COVID-19 prevention and control. We build a Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain prototype system as our testbed. Several smart contract functions are implemented and evaluated to show the efficiency of the proposed framework. In conjunction with the implementation and evaluation, we also perform comprehensive security and privacy analyses of this framework.",

Throughput can be improved by shortening the block generation interval, but that approach could sacrifice security because shorter intervals increase the fork rate. Our proposed method improves the throughput by adjusting the block generation interval to be as short as possible. Part of the nodes observe the block propagation times over the blockchain network, and the interval is determined so as not to increase the fork rate. Our simulation showed the proposed method works as it is supposed to.",

In order to solve the problem of information leakage caused by identity authentication, this paper proposes a consortium blockchain-based minimal signature authentication scheme MDSA. We use the structure of Merkle Tree to generate digital credentials for users. In particular, this scheme combining zero-knowledge proofs to provide compliance proofs for user identity attribute values to further achieve minimal authentication. We propose an attribute-based authentication model. In general, our scheme allows for self-sovereign identity, secure creation, and distributed storage. We use FISCO BCOS-based blockchain prototype system as our testbed, and the evaluations show that MDSA is feasible and secure, with linear increases in credential generation and authentication overhead.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth in emerging applications driven by blockchains, there is an increasing need to support efficient ad hoc querying of authenticated historical data to enable rigorous security and regulatory requirements. The existing blockchain systems offer little or no support for query capabilities over historical data. Although, a full blockchain archive node can be used to maintain historical data of all executed transactions' off the chain, this is not scalable due to data volume. Moreover, such \u2018offline\u2019 historical data lack tamper evidence support. To address the above issues, we introduce an authenticated index structure called Authenticated Multi-Version Skip List (AMVSL), designed to support a rich set of query features over historical blockchain data. We further present three range queries: SVRK, MVRK and MVAK, which offer querying over a range of keys and a range of versions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AMVSL can efficiently support these queries and can achieve better performance over existing authenticated data structures.",

Smartcontracts are one of the features of Ethereum blockchain, capable of running distributed applications in unreliableenvironments, enabling process automation and being one of the most sought technologies due to the highcustomization added to transactions. However, little is known about predicting the cost and execution time behavior of blockchain-based system transactions. This work aims to evaluate the performance of an Ethereum network through an application designed to analyze the cost and time of transactions that store characters in the blockchain. To meet the proposed objective, we designed an application for performing transactions with data inclusion and query on a blockchain, collecting time and cost data. As main conclusions of this work we have: the Ethereum platform proved to be inconstant in relation to the processing time of transactions on the blockchain and the application developed based on blockchain can provide a mechanism to evaluate text-type operations on Ethereum network.",

        "abstract": "IoT devices are quickly becoming a critical source of information about the physical world considered in business processes. Blockchains are a promising platform for such processes if they involve multiple parties with no shared, commonly trusted IT infrastructure. Transacting with a blockchain, however, requires software whose footprint overwhelms many lightweight IoT devices. In this paper we introduce the concept of a blockchain proxy to which an IoT device can offload a large part of this software footprint. The proxy only requires a slim proxy SDK on the device that holds a regular blockchain identity with its own private key, retaining full control of the transactions in the device. We discuss security implications and present cold-chain monitoring as a use case. Preliminary results show significant savings in CPU time and communication bandwidth for the IoT device.",

This obviates or diminishes the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with all their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem and market manipulation demerits.

        "abstract": "Since the introduction of Bitcoin, blockchain has attracted tremendous interest from both academia and industry. During the last decade, various large-scale blockchain systems were developed. However, the complexity of large-scale distributed systems makes the performance evaluation process challenging and costly. Here, blockchain simulators give the possibility to repeat complex real-world processes at a low cost. Simulators are easily extensible and can test distributed ledger performance using different settings and parameter variations. This work reviews and summarizes the current status of the state-of-the-art blockchain simulators.",

In this context, this paper proposes the protocol CONDOR (Connecting ai-based Oracles to blockchaiN via an auDitable auctiOn pRotocol) between a smart contract and some off-chain AI-based oracles to enable the smart contract to choose among AI solution proposals while inciting those oracles to provide non-forged results. The main principle is to consider the AI outcomes as auctions that can be challenged and audited through a dispute phase. An Ethereum implementation of the aforementioned protocol was built in order to assess its scalability and time performances.",

Blockchain adoption is taking on new heights in other industry verticals. As with any new technological innovation, there are challenges to the acceptance of the value of blockchain technology to the enterprise and the consumer. The chapter covers three areas that will have significant impact on the acceptance of blockchain technology: supply chain, Internet of Things, and farm to table. Medicalchain uses blockchain technology to securely store patient health records. The first blockchain layer controls access to health records and is built using Hyperledger Fabric. Blockchains are known to be a great solution for specific industry segments, but we must realize they have use cases beyond the common use cases around logistics, financial, and data exchange and can extend to other industry use cases.",

A blockchain is a growing system \u2013 an interconnected list of records that are timestamped, secured, and agreed upon by such system\u2019s participants. Blockchain stands on three basic elements: accounting, computer science, and governance systems. In accounting terms, a ledger is used to keep track of money going in, out, and around an organization or system. All blockchains are distributed ledgers, but not all distributed ledgers are blockchains and both give control of information and transactions to the users. Contracts are an essential part of any properly functioning business. Contracts legally define ownership rights and create obligations between the various parties involved. An oracle is an agreed\u2010upon and trusted third\u2010party data source. Benefits of blockchain: trustworthy, secure, transparent, efficient, and innovative. When it comes to selecting which blockchain solutions will win out in terms of gaining market share, there are several factors to consider.",

        "abstract": "The expansion of blockchain technologies from financial applications to other fields intensifies the problem of an increasing size of data stored in the blockchain. Unfortunately, new participants of the blockchain network are required to download the whole blockchain to gain an overview about the state of the system and to validate incoming transactions. Approaches like IOTA, SegWit or the Lightning Network try to solve the scalability issues of blockchain applications. Unfortunately, they focus on strategies slowing down the blockchain's growth instead of reducing the problems arising from a growing chain or introduce new concepts to oust the linear blockchain altogether. The approach proposed in this paper is based on the idea of Ethereum to keep the state of the system explicitly in the current block but further pursues this by including the relevant part of the current system state in new transactions as well. This enables other participants to validate incoming transactions without having to download the whole blockchain initially. Following this idea use cases can be supported that require scalable blockchain technology but not necessarily an indefinite and complete transaction history.",

Therefore, the application of blockchain technology, combined with the characteristics of blockchain\u2019s decentralization, non-tampering and traceability, solves the security and openness issues of government approval, and improve the traceability of government data. In the process of on-chain, multi-node verification and participation, are building the entire government approval data chain.

However, the existing distributed energy network has some problems, such as small application scop, slow development speed and lack of trust. This article proposes a decentralized, credible and efficient distributed energy transaction model based on blockchain technology in the distributed energy network. The transaction model is automatically executed through the smart contract, which deployed on the blockchain network without the participation of a third party. This approach reduces the maintenance cost of the trading system. While improving the efficiency of energy transaction, the scope of energy supply is expanded, the loss of energy transmission is reduced, the data security is improved, and the transaction process is transparent.",

        "abstract": "Many blockchain transactions require blockchain-external data sources to provide data. Oracle systems have been proposed as a link between blockchains and blockchain-external resources. However, these Oracle systems vary greatly in assumptions and applicability and each system addresses the challenge of data on-chaining partly. We argue that Data On-chaining must be done in a trustworthy manner and, as a first contribution, define a set of key requirements for Trustworthy Data On-chaining. Further, we provide an in-depth assessment and comparison of state-of-the-art Oracle systems with regards to these requirements. This differentiation pinpoints the need for a uniform understanding of and directions for future research on Trustworthy Data On-chaining.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a significant number of identity management solutions based on the blockchain technology had been proposed. From the development point of view, applications are still not mature enough and are continuously developed and tested before going into production. From the user point of view, the benefits and implications of such applications can be difficult to understand because the majority of the solutions are slowly building up their user community. How the blockchain technology influences the user's perception of personal identity and how this perception can influence the user's behavior in blockchain applications, is a significant topic that requires further research. This paper aims at offering a view on this social impact of using blockchain technology in applications. Particularly we are interested in how the self-sovereign paradigm (whose implementation is facilitated by the blockchain environment) can influence the user perception of identity in the blockchain applications.",

It explains how to justify implementations of blockchain services and hardware from a financial perspective. When IT architecture consider the economics of a blockchain solution, it is important to realize there are myriad economic decisions that an organization may consider, and those decisions can affect the outcome of a customer meeting significantly. The chapter also explains enterprise concerns related to costing. The costing models used are the capital expenditure and operational expense models. When it comes to blockchains, it is important to understand that most of the cost savings that will be realized will be through implementing \u201cbusiness logic\u201d into smart contracts. The chapter considers some of the typical cost efficiencies that blockchains can introduce into the organization. The cost efficiencies will focus on removing intermediaries that process manual transactions.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has been regarded as a promising technology for IoT because it provides significant solutions for decentralized networks that can address trust and security concerns, high maintenance cost problems, and so on. The decentralization provided by blockchain can be largely attributed to the use of a consensus mechanism, which enables peer\u2010to\u2010peer trading in a distributed manner without the involvement of any third party. This chapter starts by introducing the basic concepts of blockchain and illustrating why a consensus mechanism plays an indispensable role in a blockchain\u2010enabled IoT system. Then, we discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms, PoW and PoS, and list their limitations in IoT. After that, we introduce Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) based consensus mechanisms as an effective solution. Next, several classic scenarios of blockchain applications in the IoT are introduced. The potential issues and challenges of blockchain in IoT to be addressed in the future are discussed in the last section.",

        "abstract": "This chapter provides IT administrator a technical presales perspective on why the blockchain consensus methods vary and how this could play into an enterprise's decision to implement a specific blockchain ledger platform. It focuses on the consensus methods used in the enterprise blockchains Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, Quorum, and enterprise Ethereum. When making a design decision around enterprise blockchains and the appropriate consensus methods that can be used with a particular blockchain, it is critical to understand the main comparison points between permissioned\u2010based consensus and proof\u2010of\u2010work consensus. The chapter addresses the following consensus methods: proof of work, proof of stake, proof of elapsed time, delegated proof of stake, delegated Byzantine fault tolerance, practical Byzantine fault tolerance, Istanbul Byzantine fault tolerance, and Raft\u2010based directed acyclic graphs. The consensus methods vary widely on how consensus is reached, how a stake is arrived at, the terminology that is used, and the blockchain for which it was developed.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive computing, a revolutionary AI concept emulating human brain's reasoning process, is progressively flourishing in the Industry 4.0 automation. With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of \u201cdata island\u201d with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. Extensive evaluation and assessment findings demonstrate D2C's effectiveness relative to existing leading designs and models.",

        "abstract": "How to enable high-performance task offloading and preserve the trust between participants is imperative yet nontrivial to the Cloud-Edge-Device (CED) computing, mainly because the resources are geo-distributed and operated by different parties. Also, the CED participants are highly dynamic and heterogeneous in resource provision and may conflict in interest. This paper proposes BlockChain-empowered CED (BC-CED), a blockchain-empowered collaborative task offloading for CED computing. In BC-CED, blockchain plays a central role in the main functionality of CED, including task offloading, brokerage of resource usage, and incentives. We distinguish the BC-CED from the existing solutions by modifying the blockchain consensus process, enabling the participants to reach an agreement via solving the task offloading problem. For this purpose, we formulate the offloading problem by considering the computation capabilities of candidate nodes and the network performance. BC-CED allows each participant to apply reinforcement learning-based methods to solve this problem and compete for the right of block output by comparing the offloading policy performance and accepting the best policy as the offloading scheme within the next period. We also propose a truthful incentive mechanism to encourage resource contributions in BC-CED and force them to be honest. Extensive tests by implementing our solutions in a commercialized blockchain platform have shown how BC-CED achieves a superior performance in task offloading and blockchain maintenance.",

At present, the mainstream product traceability platform has the risk of system centralization, data being maliciously altered or destroyed. Blockchain can be effectively used in the supply chains to solve the above problems. The platform suitable for traceability system application based on Hyperledger Fabric was selected, designed a product traceability technical solution and a product traceability system solution prototype. The program content includes product traceability business requirements, architecture of traceability system, blockchain data storage scheme, transaction method and consensus mechanism, inquiry of traceability result etc. The platform of the product traceability blockchain based system in experimental environment is built and the query and verification process of the traceability on the blockchain traceability system is realized and tested, which proves the feasibility of the system.",

        "abstract": "Although Blockchain is still an emerging technology it has the potential to serve as a general purpose information technology platform. Already, smart contract / chaincode platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, provide support for the execution of arbitrary computations. However, the suitability of these platforms for specifying and enforcing data and service usage constraints (e.g., usage policies, regulatory obligations, societal norms) and providing guarantees with respect to conformance has yet to be determined. In order to address this gap, in this position paper we argue that symbolic artificial intelligence techniques in the form of semantic technology based policy languages and business process conformance tools and techniques, can together be used to provide guarantees with respect to the behaviour of autonomous smart contract / chaincode applications.",

        "abstract": "Sharding is a promising approach to scalable blockchains. While sharding eliminates duplicate work between shards, it does not remove intra-shard duplication, i.e., every peer has to verify all transactions in its shard, thus becoming a newly exposed bottleneck. Aiming to improve the performance of individual shards, we propose Collaborative Transaction Verification (CTV), which allows peers to verify fewer transactions by sharing verification results. Equipped with dependency awareness, CTV guarantees that peers reach the same system state despite different transaction verification and execution orders. We implemented an OmniLedger-like sharding protocol based on Bitcoin Core and integrated CTV into the protocol. The evaluation results show that CTV can improve the performance of a shard by 2.6x.",

        "abstract": "While the blockchain technology provides strong cryptographic protection on the ledger and the system operations, the underlying blockchain networking remains vulnerable due to potential threats such as denial of service (DoS), Eclipse, spoofing, and Sybil attacks. Effectively detecting such malicious events should thus be an essential task for securing blockchain networks and services. Due to its importance, several studies investigated anomaly detection in Bitcoin and blockchain networks, but their analyses mainly focused on the blockchain ledger in the application context (e.g., transactions) and targets specific types of attacks (e.g., double-spending, deanonymization, etc). In this study, we present a security mechanism based on the analysis of blockchain network traffic statistics (rather than ledger data) to detect malicious events, through the functions of data collection and anomaly detection. The data collection engine senses the underlying blockchain traffic and generates multi-dimensional data streams in a periodic manner. The anomaly detection engine then detects anomalies from the created data instances based on semi-supervised learning, which is capable of detecting previously unseen patterns, and we introduce our profiling-based detection engine implemented on top of AutoEncoder (AE). Our experimental results support the effectiveness of the presented security mechanism for accurate, online detection of malicious events from blockchain networking traffic data. We also show further reduction in time complexity (up to 66.8% for training and 85.7% for testing), without any performance degradation using feature prioritization compared to the utilization of the entire features.",

        "abstract": "Cross-Blockchain communication has gained traction due to the increasing fragmentation of blockchain networks and scalability solutions such as side-chaining and sharding. With SmartSync, we propose a novel concept for cross-blockchain smart contract interactions that creates client contracts on arbitrary blockchain networks supporting the same execution environment. Client contracts mirror the logic and state of the original instance and enable seamless on-chain function executions providing recent states. Synchronized contracts supply instant read-only function calls to other applications hosted on the target blockchain. Hereby, current limitations in cross-chain communication are alleviated and new forms of contract interactions are enabled. State updates are transmitted in a verifiable manner using Merkle proofs and do not require trusted intermediaries. To permit lightweight synchronizations, we introduce transition confirmations that facilitate the application of verifiable state transitions without re-executing transactions of the source blockchain. We prove the concept\u2019s soundness by providing a prototypical implementation that enables smart contract forks, state synchronizations, and on-chain validation on EVM-compatible blockchains. Our evaluation demonstrates SmartSync\u2019s applicability for presented use cases providing crosschain state access via read-only function calls. Execution costs scale sub-linearly with the number of value updates and depend on the depth and index of corresponding Merkle proofs.",

The tool introduced in this paper - Containerchain - seeks to make it much easier to spin up a large Blockchain system with little-or-no setup. The ultimate goal being to allow researchers to spend more time on actual research, rather than on setting up the network. Containerchain allows the user to deploy a real Blockchain system (not simulated) with several configurable parameters at their disposal. The user can control the number of nodes in the system, the consensus mechanism used and can observe and analyze the network traffic in the Blockchain - which is recorded out-of-the-box.",

Along with the blooming of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, an increasing number of researches focus on the transparency brought by this distributed ledger technique, which may help solve this problem. This paper aims to provide a further understanding of Blockchain technology in providing immutable and transparent records for students' educational background. Two main applications in education, called Indorse and Blockcerts were presented and we developed a new application SchooIOperated-Educational-Blockchain to provide more accurate and various information for students' in-school performance and store them securely and transparently on the Blockchain.",

        "abstract": "Enterprise business transactions have both public and private information; hence blockchain adaptation to an enterprise business application needs current blockchain platforms to support both public and private information. Public blockchains (permissionless) are optimized for transparency; hence the sharing of private and sensitive information is challenging. On the other hand, private blockchains (permissioned) separate information about a transaction by generating a public transaction and a set of private transactions and treat them separately. This separation weakens the cohesiveness of transaction information and develops an extra burden when it is necessary to connect both public and private information which is not duly addressed in the literature. For example, auditing, regulatory activities, certifications, and traceability need both the public and private information about transactions. This paper uses semantic triples and introduces the Triples for Transactions(T4T) model to define blockchain transactions, improve cohesiveness and resolve the extra burden of connecting both private and public transactions. This paper presents a user-driven transaction analysis, transaction modelling using the T4T model, semantic querying, and REST endpoints to enrich transaction management. Sets of semantic triples can define both public and private information about a transaction while preserving cohesiveness of the information. This approach supports point-to-point sharing of sensitive information while preserving implicit relationships between both private and public information. We have implemented an auditing scenario in the proposed approach adopting Hyperledger Fabric and compared for performance with Hyperledger Fabric. The results showed that the proposed approach reduces the number of transaction cycles by 66% compared to Hyperledger Fabric and the performance of information retrieval is in O(N). This result is a significant improvement compared to Hyperledger F...",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology has been presented as a support for trust needs between transactions in electronic information systems. Its successful use in cryptocurrencies has allowed it to explore its capabilities in commercial, industrial, and service systems, backed by the operational alternatives offered by Ethereum Smart Contracts and the cryptographic security of public and private key. These keys are used as a way to make online transactions anonymously, with the guarantee offered by the Blockchain network that they are executed safely. With the above in mind, this concept can be extended to the electoral processes, thus allowing its application in electronic voting systems, especially when the protocols currently used lack the trust factor between the different social actors. This document presents a proof of concept in which Blockchain and other technologies are applied, to allow interaction as an electronic voting system for the election of unique candidates. This has been achieved through the specification of an architecture designed especially for electoral processes, from which it is implemented and a simulation is carried out in order to obtain data that generates value, when evaluating Blockchain technology as an alternative to current voting systems.",

        "abstract": "Based on the research prevalence of \"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)\" and blockchain in recent years, this paper puts forward the integrated technology of these two technologies to achieve the complementary advantages of them and establish a safe and reliable application of IIoT involved with multiple industries , which is identified with a highly promising market prospect. Meanwhile, thanks to the rise of new energy, the \"energy Internet\" has been created, which results in increasingly active energy transactions. The integration of energy flow, information flow, and value flow is also in an urgent need of solution. Therefore, the term \"energy blockchain\" was invented according to the combination of energy Internet and blockchain. This paper mainly studies the energy blockchain in the IIoT background. A decentralized energy transaction program based on payment with credit-value loan will be proposed, aiming at the problem of large transaction confirmation delay in the blockchain system, which fails to support frequent and fast transactions. In this case, it supports industrial energy nodes to conduct speedy, safe and frequent energy transactions through credit payment.",

        "abstract": "Industrial procurement processes are inefficient, expensive, and error-prone as they require the agreement of numerous participants, audit-proof documentation, and are characterized by a high number of manual tasks. Blockchain technology has the potential to counter these challenges by combining peer-to-peer networks, cryptography, and consensus algorithms. A blockchain is a decentralized database that stores transactions and data transparently, chronologically, and tamper-proof in a distributed network. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based industrial marketplace, where machines have an identity and account for selecting, ordering, and paying materials in an automated manner using smart contracts. This allows manufacturers with a low real-net-output-ratio, such as car manufacturers that depend on numerous suppliers, to optimize their purchasing processes. Using our case study, we demonstrate prototypical implementation of the decentralized marketplace and its applications in the area of industrial maintenance. Furthermore, we conducted a semi-structured interview with procurement and information technology experts from the automotive industry. The results indicate that our prototype offers a promising approach streamlining procurement processes within the next two to five years.",

        "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is a distributed operating system for permissioned blockchains hosted by the Linux Foundation. It is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications at enterprise grade scale. To achieve this, Hyperledger Fabric introduces a novel execute-order-validate blockchain architecture, allowing parallelization of transaction execution and validation. However, this raises the need for transaction isolation. Today transaction isolation is attained by locking the entire state database during simulation of transactions and database updates. This lock is one of the major performance bottlenecks as observed by previous work. This work presents a new lock-free approach for providing transaction isolation. It harnesses the already existing versioning of key-value pairs in the database, used primarily for a read-write conflict detection during the validation phase, to create a version-based snapshot isolation. We further implement and evaluate our new approach. We show that our solution outperforms the current implementation by 8.1x and that it is comparable to the optimal solution where no isolation mechanism is applied.",

The reason why it has received so many people's attention is that through blockchain technology, the openness and transparency of information can be effectively guaranteed, and because of the immutability of blockchain, so that it has great application value in various fields. In corporate financial management, the application of blockchain technology to corporate tax planning and management will have a profound impact on corporate tax planning. Based on the analysis of the definition and characteristics of the blockchain, this paper can study the impact of the application of the blockchain in corporate tax planning through decentralized modeling for in-depth research. This article first introduces the steps, key points and research status of corporate tax planning, then introduces the application, development and characteristics of blockchain technology, and finally models and simulates corporate tax planning based on blockchain technology, and the results prove the reliability of the model.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays data is one of the most important assets that can be obtained, as many applications rely on data to generate useful services. However, a very few number of companies control, in a centralized manner, a large portion of data. That, combined with inefficiencies in centralized storage and recent data leak scandals, highlights the need for new ways in which data is shared and consumed, in which privacy and access control is guaranteed by design. Based on that, in this paper we present an implementation of a blockchain-based data marketplace utilizing the Go Ethereum (Geth) library. The implementation consists of an IoT node powered by a raspberry pi zero W, which is utilized to collect data from the environment and store it in an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) external server, a web page that displays the marketplace, and a private blockchain that records transactions. Regarding the private blockchain, three smart contracts are developed in order to: 1) record information about the data in the marketplace; 2) record transactions that occur between users; 3) allow sellers to white/blacklist buyers' access to the data. This implementation shows that a decentralized blockchain-based marketplace is feasible and scalable, and we hope it can serve as an early model for future frameworks.",

        "abstract": "As a decentralized ledger technology, blockchain is considered to be a potential solution for applications with highly concentrated management mechanism. However, most of the existing blockchain networks are employed with the hash-puzzle-solving consensus protocol, known as proof-of-work. The competition of solving the puzzle introduces high latency, which directly leads to a long transaction-processing time. One solution of this dilemma is to establish a blockchain network with shards. In this paper, we focus on the blockchain network with shards and adopt the security-deposit based consensus protocol, studying the problem of how to balance the security incentive and the economic incentive. Also, the inherent features of the blockchain, i.e., anonymity and decentralization, introduce the information asymmetric issue between the beacon chain and the participants. The contract theory is utilized to formulate the problem between them. As such, the optimal rewards related to the different types of validators can be obtained, as well as the reasonable deposits accordingly. Compared with the fixed deposits, the flexible deposits can provide enough economic incentive for the participants without losing the security incentives. Besides, the simulation results demonstrate that the contract theory approach is capable of maximizing the beacon chain's utility and satisfying the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the participants.",

However, most current fast-booming blockchain platforms keep bringing new fashion features, which will bring the cost of breaking changes between different releases of the platform. This can be a barrier for developers especially beginners to start their development. To resolve such issue, in this work, we introduce a smart contract development platform called DevLeChain, which comes with unified access method, easy-to-understand development workflow, and constant design philosophy. DevLeChain can provide an easy toolset to customize and control the underlying blockchain's behavior, whereby developers can easily start developing blockchain-based systems. Also, the provided smart contract automation testing tools allow developers to quickly realize their code.",

        "abstract": "Insurance claims processing involves multi-domain entities and multi-source data, along with a number of human-agent interactions. Consequently, this processing is traditionally manually-intensive and time-consuming. Blockchain technology-based platforms for intelligent automation can significantly improve the scale and response time of claims processing. However, there is a need to secure such platforms against fraud (e.g., duplicate claims) and the loss of data integrity caused due to cyber-attacks (e.g., Sybil attack). In this paper, we propose a novel \u201cClaimChain\u201d, a consortium Blockchain platform that transforms the state-of-the-art NICB/ISO database architecture approach through increased shared intelligence and participation of insurance companies. ClaimChain features include: (a) automation of insurance claim processing via implementation of a Blockchain infrastructure, (b) infrastructure-level threat modeling via attack tree formalism for data integrity attacks, and (c) application-level fraud modeling for identified prominent red flags through machine learning models and risk scoring on the basis of risk severity. We evaluate the scalability of ClaimChain by simulating realistically large number of Blockchain transactions of claim processing. Further, we show that data integrity attacks at the infrastructure-level can be mitigated (as seen in reduction of 24% probability in loss) through implementation of security design principles. We also perform fraud-detection over an open dataset in ClaimChain to show how machine learning models can detect fraudulent activity with 98% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The security of smart contracts has drawn attention in recent years due to their immutability and ability to hold assets. Existing machine learning and deep learning methods addressing vulnerabilities in smart contracts often partially combine pooled features from first the contract source code, second, the build based approach made of features extracted during source code compilation, and third, the bytecode approach relying on features obtained from the Ethereum virtual machine bytecode analysis. Together those three approaches form the full-stack, and they are usually being conducted under static analysis thanks to its speed of execution. However, to the best of our knowledge, no single work has yet simultaneously undertaken a full-stack intralayer and cross-layer features fusion for smart contracts vulnerability assessment under static analysis, without making use of expert-based patterns nor without manually fusing the various features extracted from shuffled partial combinations of layers in the full-stack. This paper introduces a full-stack hierarchical fusion of static features for smart contracts vulnerability detection. In our construction, we associate each layer of the full-stack to a modality and leverage automatic intramodality and crossmodality pooled features fusion from state-of-the-art artificial neural networks and deep neural networks. Additionally, our models are applied to the hierarchy of power set layers in the full-stack, without any expert-based rule. Furthermore, our work aims to assess the increase in vulnerability detection performance and provide guidance for future research on smart contracts vulnerability detection.",

This could be illegal purchasing, money laundering, or carrying out a fraud of some type\u2014which can all be achieved on a blockchain system. This chapter explains how to extract raw hexadecimal information from a block on the chain and analyzes its key components. It looks at the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum headers. When conducting an investigation, the investigator will often stumble across a block number, which is also referred to as the block height. Forks in a blockchain are often considered to be very complex, but in reality, this concept is not very difficult to understand. Several different types of forks relate to a blockchain and this chapter discusses a type of orphan fork.",

This chapter focuses primarily on enterprise concerns for common enterprise blockchains, including the smart contracts that can be used to maintain personal data. Blockchain services can have a major impact on governance, risk, and compliance functions, which include the following key areas of the business: IT governance, corporate and IT audits, policy management and regulatory change management, enterprise risk management, and smart contracts. Historically, compliance requirements for enterprises focused both on common concerns, such as privacy, and on more specialized concerns, such as requirements for healthcare, credit cards, and government\u2010mandated requirements. A blockchain architect will likely run into several concerns around the General Data Protection Regulation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Sarbanes\u2010Oxley Act of 2002, Know Your Customer, anti\u2010money\u2010laundering rules, and so on.",

        "abstract": "With the widespread of 5G networks, the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Internet of Things (IoT) has become a trend. However, the trust problem caused by the centralized aggregation server, and the inefficiency problem caused by the low-performance devices, are still key challenges. Several studies involving asynchronous FL have been conducted to accelerate the training process, but they usually have a decreased model performance. In this paper, a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning framework with a dynamic scaling factor is proposed. By adopting the blockchain, the trust problem among devices can be addressed. Meanwhile, the novel dynamic scaling factor is proposed to help improve the FL efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on heterogeneous devices and the results show that the proposed framework mitigates the impact of low-performance devices while being as efficient as traditional FL with the extra benefit of alleviating the trust problem among IoT devices.",

        "abstract": "Cloud storage enables users to upload, store and download their data. However, with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices, such as camera, the cloud not only manages the user generate data but also devices generated data. This increment in the volume of outsourced data has raised two important issues in big data management for cloud storage servers, namely, optimal data storage and data security. In order to solve the former issue, cloud storage employs a deduplication technique to avoids storing duplicate data; and uses encryption to solve the later issue. However, both these issues are orthogonal in nature. Thanks to convergent encryption that addresses both the issues simultaneously. Nevertheless, the existing approaches relies on proxy servers and put all the trust on third party, which is vulnerable to single point failure. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight decentralized encrypted cloud storage architecture called, Yugula, which maintains file confidentiality, removes the centralized data deduplication and increases file integrity by using blockchain. In particular, we discuss two approaches for file confidentiality with data deduplication: one uses double hashing and the other symmetric encryption. In order to show the efficiency and usability, we implemented the proposed architecture and showed its results in terms of high transaction throughput requirement for IoT data management in cloud storage.",

        "abstract": "Because of availability of many blockchain development platforms, the number of blockchain related projects on Github has grown significantly, averaging over 8,000 new projects a year. But selection of the best development framework for a project requires one to compare and contract features of those available platfroms, since there is no report or paper - to the best of our knowledge - that provides a brief introduction to available platforms. In this paper we first provide a table of 15 most popular open-source platforms. In the rest of the paper we summarize features and development supports that available from those blockchain development cores.",

        "abstract": "Integrating blockchain into software solutions is not straightforward as it requires sophisticated architectural design to connect and orchestrate centralized elements, such as backend logic, with decentralized elements, such as blockchain ledgers and smart contracts. We systematically explore this design space and possible architectural solution approaches. More specifically, we provide architectural blue prints for applications with different degrees of decentralization, describe conceptional components as well as possible relations between them. Our research shows that an event-driven architecture incorporating a messaging framework, tethered to dedicated components for handling blockchain state-changing and state-collecting operations, is a prevalent approach for choreographing blockchain-dependent business logic in blockchain-based applications.",

        "abstract": "The growing chain\u2019s storage requirements are al- ways an issue with blockchain platforms, and devices may not allocate the required storage to replicate an entire blockchain instance. To overcome this issue, we propose a storage constraint-free blockchain model that divides the growing blockchain into fixed-size sets of blocks, excluding the genesis block and allowing the participating nodes to store the recent blocks according to their storage capacity. Suppose a node decides not to replicate a few sets of old blocks to accommodate the blockchain according to its storage availability. In that case, it stores the corresponding set\u2019s last block hash and the XOR of the remaining blocks\u2019 hashes and then drops those blocks. Nodes that receive blocks, equivalent to the deleted blocks from other nodes will validate it by comparing the previous set\u2019s last block hash with the received set\u2019s first block parent hash and XOR hash with the block hashes. If they match, the node will accept the equivalent set of deleted blocks; otherwise, reject. This will guarantee to avoid any uncertainty, single collision multi-block replacement, and partial chain replacement attack. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed model is storage efficient and needs less overhead. The proposed model provides security equivalent to the traditional blockchain and allows the storage constrained devices to participate in the application for a long time compared with the other models.",

        "abstract": "Blockchains gained tremendous attention for their capability to provide immutable and decentralized event ledgers that can facilitate interactions between mutually distrusting parties. However, precisely this immutability and the openness of permissionless blockchains raised concerns about the consequences of illicit content being irreversibly stored on them. Related work coined the notion of redactable blockchains, which allow for removing illicit content from their history without affecting the blockchain's integrity. While honest users can safely prune identified content, current approaches either create trust issues by empowering fixed third parties to rewrite history, cannot react quickly to reported content due to using lengthy public votings, or create large per-redaction overheads.In this paper, we instead propose to outsource redactions to small and periodically exchanged juries, whose members can only jointly redact transactions using chameleon hash functions and threshold cryptography. Multiple juries are active at the same time to swiftly redact reported content. They oversee their activities via a global redaction log, which provides transparency and allows for appealing and reversing a rogue jury's decisions. Hence, our approach establishes a framework for the swift and transparent moderation of blockchain content. Our evaluation shows that our moderation scheme can be realized with feasible per-block and per-redaction overheads, i.e., the redaction capabilities do not impede the blockchain's normal operation.",

        "abstract": "The study of the adoption of Blockchain Technology (BT) of the Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) automotive components industry still in infancy. BT's previous research topic mostly in virtual currency, security, and IoT. However, the automotive market's significant development causes several issues in the SCMS automotive components industry, such as fake components. Blockchain Technology (BT), as identified, might be possible as a way out for the development of SCMS automotive components. There are several research questions in this research, such as how BT can facilitate SCMS open issues? What is the BT impact in the SCM area? The study method used the systematic literature review (SLR) method to gather all information from 12 publishers and an international index journal. Seven open issues identified in this study and SCM's core operational aspect, such as supplier, logistics, manufacturer, distribution, and customer, have been identified impact with BT.",

        "abstract": "Even though there are researchers focused on implementing blockchain in auditing aspects, some data is cumbersome, and storing it on a blockchain requires too much computational cost. That's where a hybrid solution would be better. We aim to provide a blockchain-off-chain mechanism in the supply chain area. This paper presents an audit mechanism that, in the first instance, saves all the events (records) of a supply chain within a blockchain in a hashed form. In a second instance, users of a supply chain system can query integrity, data provenance, and traceability to blockchain through an intermediate server that establishes communication between blockchain and the supply chain. Our proposal has been validated employing a proof of concept where, some avocado supply chain services have been implemented using a microservices architecture.",

        "abstract": "The literature on blockchain technology and circular economy is at a nascent stage, with only initial limited and superficial recognition of the possible role blockchain may have in supporting circular economy laws and policies. This paper contributes to this emerging area by exploring the regulatory opportunities and challenges for adoption of blockchain for circular waste management. In particular, through a mixed methods approach combining empirical and doctrinal research, this paper presents initial findings on: (1) the current role of blockchain within the legal landscape on circular economies; (2) the regulatory barriers of blockchain application to circular economies; and (3) opportunities of blockchain in supporting regulatory mechanisms promoting circularity.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning and blockchain technology have been explored for potential applications in medicine with only modest success to date. Focus has shifted to exploring the intersection of these technologies along with other privacy preserving encryption techniques for better utility. This combination applied to federated learning, which allows remote execution of function and analysis without the need to move highly regulated personal health information, seems to be the key to successful applications of these technologies to rapidly advance evidence-based medicine. We give a brief history of these technologies in medicine, outlining some of the challenges with successful use. We then explore a more detailed combination of usage with an emphasis on decentralizing or federating the learning process along with auditability and incentivization blockchain can allow in the machine learning process. Based on the cost-benefit analysis of previous efforts, we provide the framework for an advanced blockchain-orchestrated machine learning system for privacy preserving federated learning in medicine and a new utility in health. Six critical elements for this approach in the future will be:(a) Data and analytic processes discoverable on secure public blockchain while retaining privacy of the data and analytic processes(b) Value fabricated by generating data/compute matches that were previously illegal, unethical and infeasible(c) Compute guarantees provided by federated learning and advanced cryptography(d) Privacy guarantees provided by software (e.g., Homomorphic Encryption, Secure Multi-Party Computation, ...) and hardware (e.g., Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP) cryptography(e) Data quality incentivized via tokenized reputation-based rewards(f) Discarding of poor data accomplished via model poisoning attack prevention techniques.",

Blockchain is widely used in the field of access control with its decentralization, traceability and non-defective modification. Combining the blockchain technology and the Bell-LaPadula model, we propose a new access control model, named BC-BLPM, for MLS environment. The \u201cmulti-chain\u201d blockchain architecture is used for dividing resources into isolated access domains, providing a fine-grained data protection mechanism. The access control policies are implemented by smart contracts deployed in each access domain, so that the side chains of different access domains storage access records from outside and maintain the integrity of the records. Finally, we implement the BC-BLPM prototype system using the Hyperledger Fabric. The experimental and analyt-ical results show that the model can adapt well to the needs of multi-level security environment, and it has the feasibility of application in actual scenarios.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing application of blockchain technology in decentralized data management systems (DMS), the prevailing problems of poor query performance relative to its conventionally centralized counterparts are in urgent need of reasonable solutions. Bloom filters are efficient data query frameworks that adopt multiple hash functions to map the target database into one-dimensional arrays (one bit per array cell), leading to high-efficiency information extraction and fulfilling the urgent optimization needs of the blockchain's query performance. In light of the above background, dual Bloom filters were proposed herein to accelerate the inspection speed of user information in a blockchain DMS. Taking into account the different scenarios for user registration and user login, a comparative experiment was conducted between the conventional methods and the proposed algorithm, with the latter outperforming the former, as revealed by the results. The proposed algorithm has proven to be capable of swiftly completing not only the duplicate detection of usernames for newly-registered accounts but also the parallel query for the username and password during user login. This functionality has greatly reduced noise from irrelevant information and improved the query performance of blockchain-based hyperledgers.",

The metaphor of the cloud was borrowed from old telecoms network schematics, in which the public telephone network was often represented as a cloud to denote that the just did not a matter it was just a cloud of stuff. However, cost and risk will increase inthe organization which are using cloud platforms. Hence this paper combines Cloud with blockchain technology to produce a secured file storage system. Blockchain is considered by many to be the safest technology. Here, a single file is splited and stored in blocks using the file manipulation and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms. A high level, contract oriented language, Solidity is used for writing smart contracts. The system architecture which explains the cloud and blockchain processes is constructed. This system also ensures that it is free from attacks such as Brute force. Finally, the blockchain network in the cloud platform is implemented.",

        "abstract": "The incorporation of technology to the healthcare ecosystem is identified as a potential strategy to improve people\u2019s quality of life. The health ecosystem includes several interested and interconnected parties with different needs, entailing a high degree of information exchange between the actors involved. However, this information is highly fragmented and distributed, making continuous access difficult. Health care requires a permanent flow of such information, where health systems interoperate to have a global view of the historical data of a patient. However, there are several problems that prevent this objective to be met, this work is focused on identifying such problems. In this sense, Blockchain technology has a great opportunity to support the health sector, since it has multiple qualities that make it ideal for supporting the interoperability of health management systems. This document shows some of the most critical and challenging issues facing the interoperability of health systems, such as: health standards and smart contracts. Challenges for the interoperability of healthcare systems using blockchain technology are also identified and a solution from a software engineering perspective is shown. By doing this, our research extends and complements existing blockchain research in healthcare.",

Although some research explores the uses of the blockchain and practice it in the real world, blockchain has not yet been applied widely in the education area. The goal of this research is to present an academic records verification platform which is cost-effective and secure based on the blockchain. Previous research on the applications of the blockchain and the RSA algorithm lays a strong foundation for this study. The decentralized nature of the blockchain is utilized to testify the academic honesty of students, and RSA algorithm protects the privacy of individuals. Plus, the demands of different groups of people contribute to constructing a user-friendly platform. Next, the framework of the platform is presented, including the procedures of verification and query, and the traditional platform of student record verification and this platform are compared. Lastly, the conclusion analyzes the efficiency and explains the way how the platform is useful to people and a few limitations existing in the practice of the platform. This research studys established papers to analyze novel technology, the demands of people and the analysis of traditional platform for proposing a novel framework of the student record verification platform. The result shows that the platform is more cost-effective and convenient than conventional way of verification.",

        "abstract": "This systematic review investigates consumer trust in blockchain applications and makes recommendations for future research. The review targeted papers focusing on blockchain applications, collecting data from a consumer perspective, and examining trust as an outcome variable. We excluded non-peer-reviewed papers written before 2008 or in languages other than English. Our search in 5 databases yielded 704 studies. 29 studies were retained for the full-text review and 5 studies were included after conflict resolution. The small number of studies retained for analysis highlights the need for further empirical research on consumer trust in blockchain technology. While blockchain remained a mysterious term for most consumers, trust was the main factor determining the use of blockchain applications. Additionally, interface design, service, and information quality, together with the platform's ability to allow consumers to investigate products using blockchain applications. Trust remains the central issue for blockchain as trust in this \u201ctrustless\u201d system appears to be a prerequisite for actual use, creating a \u201ctrust paradox\u201d. This systematic review on consumer trust in blockchain technology is the first to provide a preliminary synthesis of consumers' needs and expectations for blockchain developers and provides important directions for future research on blockchain applications.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has attracted extensive attention because of its decentralized and tamper-proof characteristics. However, with the vigorous development of blockchain, problems also follow. Once the data is stored in the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with, making the blockchain an extrajudicial place for low-cost cybercrime. Criminals use the blockchain to store pornographic, attack scripts, dark network service addresses and other lousy information; Even if the blockchain is used commonly, it will encounter a series of problems, such as that malicious transactions cannot be eradicated and wrong transactions cannot be modified. Therefore, the editable blockchain scheme under specific conditions has broad application prospects. This paper proposes an editable blockchain scheme based on Shamir chameleon hash key sharing. Using the characteristics of chameleon hash, the overall structure of the edited blockchain is not affected. Shamir key sharing algorithm can ensure that each editing is the collective will of nodes. Simulation results show that this scheme has higher security and compatibility than similar schemes.",

To solve this problem, a consensus performance optimisation method that integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM) and PBFT is proposed in this research. Firstly, SVM is used to evaluate the trust of consensus nodes in blockchain network. By selecting a consensus node with a high degree of trust as the primary node to reduce the possibility of dishonest nodes as the primary node. Then, introduce a dynamic adjustment credit incentive mechanism to the blockchain network by reducing the consensus trust of malicious nodes and inactive nodes in the blockchain, which will improve the security of the supply chain system. Finally, the experimental results show that, comparing with the existing methods, the consensus node trust evaluation and credit incentive mechanism have improved the throughput and latency of the supply chain blockchain application.",

Such centralized entities may intervene to prevent the propagation of social media content that it considers as misinformation. However, such vetting entities may be biased and may selectively prevent misinformation. In this chapter, we propose a blockchain\u2010based decentralized content vetting for social network. We use Bitcoin as the underlying blockchain model, and we develop a unidirectional channel model to execute the vetting procedure. In this vetting procedure, all users get a chance to vote for and against a content. Content with sufficient positive votes is considered as the vetted content. We optimize the offline channel network topology to reduce computation overhead due to using blockchains. We prove the efficiency of the vetting procedure with experiments using simulations of content propagation in social network.",

It focuses on Ethereum, Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Quorum. Blockchains that support smart contracts in Java include NEM, NEO, and Corda. Developers should note that Ethereum is geared toward applications that automate direct interaction between peers or that facilitate group routines over the Ethereum decentralized network. The chapter also provides a broad idea of what a developer in Hyperledger Fabric would need to deal with and develop around. It focuses on the similarities and major differences between Quorum and Ethereum. The performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum is a result of the global scale, Internet reliance, and transaction workloads.",

        "journal_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9805560/",
        "abstract": "Existing PoW blockchains adopt a simple k-block confirmation rule. A block is confirmed after it is buried sufficiently deep in the blockchain. Such confirmation does not guarantee transaction finality. Specifically, after a block is confirmed, a miner may later confirm a different block in the same position of the blockchain. The previously confirmed block effectively gets reversed. A common reason for block reversal is that an adversary could privately maintain a malicious chain. The adversary releases the malicious chain once it is longer than the blockchain of at least one honest miner.In this paper, we propose a new confirmation method that relies on checkpoints to prevent the adversary from withholding its blocks. A checkpoint contains one or more blocks at the same position of the blockchain. Unlike existing protocols, we propose a simple mechanism to establish checkpoint blocks without introducing any trusted third parties. A committee is selected periodically to vote for checkpoint blocks. Miners only confirm a block when it is referenced by all checkpoint blocks at some block height, among other criteria. We prove the liveness and safety of this new confirmation rule. We show that conditioning on honest majority within a committee, miners achieve 0 confirmation reversal probability. We demonstrate that with majority mining power being honest, we could always select a proper checkpoint period to ensure the assumption of the majority of a committee being honest holds for hundreds of years on average. In the rare case where this assumption is broken, miners in the checkpoint-enabled blockchain still incur the same reversal probability as in the current k-block confirmation.",

        "abstract": "Most Intelligent Vehicles (IVs) can sense and share traffic conditions using embedded advanced sensing devices. However, the integrity, reliability, and availability of this data against potential attacks in the vehicular network remain a challenge. Recently, blockchain technology has been proposed to address these security concerns. Additional enhancements in the blockchain protocol are still needed to minimize the confirmation delay of traffic data. This work takes advantage of the traffic event validation context to improve the performance of the blockchain while main-taining the decentralization and security properties of the system. We propose a trust model that selects the most appropriate Road Side Units (RSUs) as event validators based on their reputation and distance from the event location. The proposed scheme was validated by simulation, and results showed good improvement in blockchain performance, decentralization, and fairness of the event validation process.",

The marketplace actors can audit and trust the correctness and neutrality of the smart contract to act as a neutral third party. While many such marketplaces have been demonstrated, they are constrained to operate in a single blockchain. We present a decentralized marketplace spread over two blockchains, allowing separation of concerns between different blockchains and simultaneously increasing overall performance. The presented marketplace shows how smart lockers are rented on the platform, and how access tokens to the rented lockers are communicated securely in a manner that facilitates off-grid physical access.",

It integrates a variety of technologies such as cryptography, peer-to-peer network, consensus algorithm and smart contract, and has been gradually applied in various fields. The contradiction between the rapid development of blockchain industry and the incompleteness of evaluation system and technical means has become increasingly prominent. The vulnerability of blockchain system is an important part of blockchain evaluation system. It is of great significance for the development of blockchain technology and large-scale application to fully study the vulnerability of blockchain system and conduct quantitative evaluation or real-time monitoring. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerability of blockchain, and puts forward the technical indicators to evaluate the vulnerability of blockchain. Based on the vulnerability technical index of blockchain consensus algorithm and industrial blockchain consensus algorithm PBFT, a consensus algorithm confrontation deduction model is designed, and the vulnerability index of blockchain system using PBFT is experimentally simulated and evaluated.",

We evaluate state-of-the-art simulators and find that they suffer from low performance and scalability. To build a more general and faster blockchain simulator, we extend an existing blockchain simulator. We add a network module integrated with a network topology generation algorithm and a block propagation algorithm to simulate the block propagation efficiently. We design a binary transaction pool structure and adopt bitwise operations to accelerate the simulation and reduce memory usage. Moreover, we modularize the simulator based on five primary blockchain processes. Significant blockchain elements are implemented in individual modules and can be combined flexibly to simulate different types of blockchains. Experiments demonstrate that the new simulator reduces the simulation time by an order of magnitude and improves scalability, enabling us to simulate more than ten thousand nodes.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT) are considered two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation fo...",

We develop a new technique that leverages the mainchain of a popular blockchain platform like Bitcoin, together with a mixing service and a group signature scheme, to provide anonymity and traceability; we connect this to a sidechain, pegged to the mainchain, that brings a better scalability. We implemented the technique on the joint platform Bitcoin/RootStock and use CoinJoin/CoinShuffle as the mixing service. The evaluation section shows a decrease by 99 % in the execution cost of our protocol compared to the same implementation on a smart-contract-friendly blockchain such as Ethereum.",

        "abstract": "Reliable identity management and authentication are significant for network security. In recent years, as traditional centralized identity management systems suffer from security and scalability problems, decentralized identity management has received considerable attention in academia and industry. However, with the increasing sharing interaction among each domain, management and authentication of decentralized identity has raised higher requirements for cross-domain trust and faced implementation challenges galore. To solve these problems, we propose BIdM, a decentralized cross- domain identity management system based on blockchain. We design a decentralized identifier (DID) for naming identities based on the consortium blockchain technique. Since the identity subject fully controls the life cycle and ownership of the proposed DID, it can be signed and issued without a central authentication node's intervention. Simultaneously, every node in the system can participate in identity authentication and trust establishment, thereby solving the centralized mechanism's single point of failure problem. To further improve authentication efficiency and protect users' privacy, BIdM introduces a one-way accumulator as an identity data structure, which guarantees the validity of entity identity. We theoretically analyze the feasibility and performance of BIdM and conduct evaluations on a prototype implementation. The experimental results demonstrate that BIdM achieves excellent optimization on cross-domain authentication compared with existing identity management systems.",

        "abstract": "Democracy plays a significant part in voting. If the voting process is not clear, stable and tamper proof, the integrity and legitimacy of the entire system is at risk. In recent years, neither civilians nor elected leaders have appreciated traditional ballots. Elections are surrounded by vote falsification, bribery and other voting problems. Often an individual must stand in a long line of people while casting votes and the procedure is quite lengthy. There has to be an exceptional feature of modern technologies to upgrade the existing system. Block chain provides the various features that will alter the scenario. But to implement ethereum based blockchain is expensive as for each transaction there is a computation cost. So we have used the sidechain concept to provide a cost effective blockchain based voting mechanism as sidechain extends the capabilities of blockchain by performing some operation besides it using duplicate currency and returns the result to mainchain for its use.",

        "abstract": "As the internet continues to grow, networked devices are expanding not only in number, but variety as well. The Internet of Things presents an opportunity to connect every-day devices in new and intelligent ways, whether those devices are as mundane as kitchen appliances, or as complex as Autonomous Vehicles. To ensure the security of information in these sometimes public-facing, geographically distributed networks, devices cannot trust one another blindly. A Blockchain protocol may be ideal in that it trades trust in individuals for trust in cryptography, but the performance of such protocols can suffer in densely populated networks. To provide a scalable solution to Blockchain implementations IoT networks, this paper proposes a framework that utilizes a hierarchically distributed Blockchain network with horizontal connections between select devices at each layer to balance traffic without creating a single point of failure.",

        "abstract": "In the campus network billing system, in addition to online authentication, real-time monitoring of traffic and fees, network fee recharge is also an extremely important functional module. However, the traditional Internet fee recharge method has problems such as users need to line up at a designated place to recharge, the processing speed is slow, and the time for receiving the account is not timely. In response to the above problems, the article combines the actual network environment of colleges and universities with the specific needs of the campus integrated payment system model, and designs and develops a campus integrated payment system based on the blockchain architecture. The system uses blockchain technology based on the Fabric architecture, uses asymmetric encryption algorithms, Byzantine algorithms and other technologies to design and develop a campus-converged payment system with security, reliability, and decentralization. Practical application shows that this method has better feature resolution ability for blockchain distributed big data fusion. The high integration of campus payment and social payment is another practice of \u201cInternet+\u201d campus application, which will play a positive role in promoting the construction of campus informatization.",

        "abstract": "Storing information in Blockchain has become in vogue in the Technical and Communication Industry with many major players jumping into the bandwagon. Two of the most prominent enablers for Blockchain are \u201cProof of Work\u201d and \u201cProof of Stake\u201d. Proof of work includes the members solving the complex problem without having a particular need for the solution (except as evidence, of course), which absorbs a large number of resources in turn. The proof of stake doesn\u2019t require as many resources to enable Blockchain secure information store. Both methodologies have their advantages and their shortcomings. The article attempts to review the current literature and collate the results of the study to measure the performance of both the methodologies and to arrive at a consensus regarding either or both methodologies to implement Blockchain to store data. Post reviewing the performance aspects and security features of both Proofs of Stake and Proof of Work the reviewer attempts to arrive at a secure and better performing blended Blockchain methodology that has wide industry practical application.",

        "abstract": "Being the center of commotion in recent times, Blockchain Technology is on its way to bloom in the technological world. With countless applications, even governments and health facilities are adopting blockchain technology into their applications because of the reliability and security it is supposed to provide. Not to mention how it bought about revolution in currency by making it possible for crypto-currency to exist as introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in his ground-breaking paper. Unfortunately like every other technology in existence, blockchain is also potentially vulnerable no matter how secure it was meant to be designed. We will take a look at such potential threats to the blockchain technology in this paper, from seemingly human factors to some technical aspects that are not too deep to understand for anyone. We will also discuss about the possible remedies to the explored threats to the blockchain technology.",

        "abstract": "Counterfeit items have become more prevalent in the industrial industry in recent years. This has an effect on the company\u2019s name, sales, and profit. Blockchain technology is used to authenticate and identify counterfeit items.Using blockchain technology, transactions are recorded in the form of blocks in a distributed, decentralized, and digital ledger. A block cannot be changed or hacked since blockchain technology is secure. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for customers or users to rely on third parties to verify the product\u2019s safety. In light of current advancements in mobile and wireless technologies, quick response (QR) codes provide a promising technique for addressing the practice of counterfeiting in this project. This is done by scanning a QR code, which is linked to a Blockchain, to identify counterfeit goods. As a consequence, this method may be used to record product information and generate a unique identifier for each product in a database. It looks up the user\u2019s unique code in the Blockchain database and sees if there are any matches. When a code matches, the client will be notified; otherwise, the consumer will be notified that the product is counterfeit.",

        "abstract": "Various services based on blockchain technology are reported daily. There are many unfortunate proposals to use blockchain as a distributed database merely, and a flowchart that allows you to self-confirm whether blockchain is really necessary there has been announced. Under these circumstances, as an example of making good use of blockchain technology, digital issuance of claims corresponding to physical certificates such as diplomas is considered to be one of the suitable applications, and there are cases where it was actually put into service.In this paper, we consider a new model that assumes that IDs are given ERC735 claim-style credentials in the Ethereum blockchain. We can think of \"cotton candy\" as a metaphor that expresses how multiple claims cling to a specific ID, that we can entangle various attributes by an identifier (a stick of the cotton candy). We will introduce a use case in which such credentials are stored in the blockchain and can confirm official certificates such as proof of enrollment in the digital space, and propose a new concept called e-KYC-e. e-KYC-e is considered to be socially acceptable because in the last few years multiple vendors and consortia have been able to manage their own DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and concepts such as SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) to control their \"cotton candy\".",

        "abstract": "Blockchain platforms are generally applied to automate operations using a trusted environment with broadcast messaging and distributed data storing. At the same time corporates still have business requirements to also send confidential peer-to-peer messages or private transactions. Mainly these requirements derive from the law obligations (bank secrecy, GDPR, etc.) and the necessity to protect competitive market advantages. Blockchain platforms for public networks ignore requirements for private transactions due to user anonymity and the absence of personal data in blockchain networks. Enterprise blockchain platforms for corporate networks mostly address confidential issues by transferring private data through trusted third parties (TTP) or intermediaries, and off-chain peer-to-peer messaging. However, these approaches miss core blockchain advantages of a trusted environment - immutability and integrity of private data. This article introduces a new technique and its implementation of private transactions in a blockchain that is based on both off-chain peer-to-peer messaging with confidential data and broadcast transactions that contain hashes of private data to verify immutability and integrity. The article provides technical details of the method, also performance issues are discussed.",

Blockchain technology is not a single, brand-new technology, but the result of the integration of multiple existing technologies (such as encryption algorithms, P2P file transmission, etc.). These technologies are cleverly combined with the database to form a New ways of recording, transferring, storing and presenting data. Since its inception, the technological trend of blockchain plus the wealth effect has given people unlimited imagination and made the public crazy. However, its value can only be reflected after it is combined with commercial applications. This article starts with the classification of blockchain news, associates it with the significance of blockchain technology for news dissemination, and finally takes ContentBox as an example to explore how \u201cdigital content + blockchain\u201d creates value.",

Having a central database server is not a 100% safe alternative to paper-based traditional records as it is susceptible to cyber-attacks and frauds. This paper proposes an idea to solve this issue using blockchain. The proposed land records system is based on a hybrid blockchain network. The existing land records are put on the blockchain by the government. All land sales transactions are recorded on this hybrid blockchain. These transactions are mined (verified) by a miner which is run on government authorized peers or nodes. These records or transactions cannot be tampered with. The citizens can view their owned lands and corresponding transactions but cannot make changes to any data on the blockchain. Being based on hybrid blockchain, this system is benefitted by advantages of both the types of blockchain-public and private and is more secure and reliable than databases and paper records.",

        "abstract": "Data center (DC) interconnection allows us to have optical transmissions between DCs directly connected to optical networks, avoiding the use of a packet-based infrastructure. Thanks to the use of next-generation pluggable coherent optics, it is possible to create connectivity services (CSs) across multiple optical transport domains. In this multi-domain CS scenario, cloud operators and transport operators have to work together in the most dynamic way possible. To do so, they need a common place (i.e., a market) where the transport operators may expose their available optical resources and the cloud operators request (e.g., rent) them to be used in order to create end-to-end (E2E) CSs between DCs. Having multiple transport operators exposing their resource information in a common place requires a set of common rules (i.e., how much of the topology to show) to create E2E CSs requested between cloud operators. This paper makes use of the blockchain technology to present a blockchain-based extension for the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to allow each optical transport operator domain to become a peer in a blockchain network. In there, each peer follows the same rules and shares the same exact level of topology information by using a specific abstraction model to map the optical domain resources. This paper uses a set of three different abstraction models to validate their behavior on a blockchain system when managing multiple domain resources and the deployment of CSs across these domains. To do so, an experimental comparison on how the different abstraction models affect the performance of the blockchain system is presented.",

        "abstract": "The low performance of blockchains has been considered as one of the main challenges in deploying blockchains. This blockchain performance has been discussed and analyzed for further improvements, especially in wired blockchains. In wired blockchains, transactions, messages for consensus protocols (CPs), and new blocks are all transmitted through wired links. However, even though wireless blockchains have actively emerged in recent years, most of blockchain works are still focused on wired blockchains. Being different from wired blockchains, transactions, messages for CPs, and new blocks can face the characteristics of wireless communications, such as limited communication resources, path loss, and higher interference. This is highly influential on the performance of wireless blockchains, especially on CPs that play an important role in fault tolerance inside blockchains. In this paper, therefore, we discuss the impacts of communications on wireless blockchains. We then provide trade-offs and future challenges, which need to be newly considered for higher performance in wireless blockchains.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology is an immutable append-only decentralized ledger that theoretically makes it an ideal data storage system. The nature of blockchain design ensures stored data is reliable, trustworthy, and transparent. However, the blockchain's full-replication feature makes it ineffective to store a large volume of data directly on-chain. This paper provides a systematic review and analysis of existing decentralized file systems. Our focus was on systems that can support large, high-frequency data writing while still providing swift and easy data retrieval for blockchain-based applications. The challenge, in our view, is to find ways to achieve those efficiency outcomes while still retaining the key decentralized features of blockchain design. With that in mind, we assessed the costs involved in using nine state-of-the-art decentralized file systems and we also considered their latency performance.",

We study how a distributed alternative based on blockchain and smart contract technology could replace the costly and inefficient third\u2010party\u2010based trust intermediaries. We propose a smart contract based on a sealed\u2010bid double auction to allow resource providers and enterprise users to trade resources on a distributed marketplace. We have explained the implementation of this marketplace application on Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain while deploying the network using a pragmatic scenario over a public, commercial cloud. We evaluated the distributed marketplace's performance under different transaction loads, and the results showed that the marketplace could process up to 400 auction transactions per second while maintaining the latency under 1\u2009s.",

        "abstract": "Medical data sharing is increasingly becoming an integral part of modern healthcare management. Mobility of patients, healthcare financing, and changing modes of care require that health data pass from the institutions that generate the data to others that need it to support healthcare delivery outcomes. These factors lead to challenges that render the sharing arrangement necessary but vulnerable to attack by malicious users. The conventional paradigms of sharing do not include techniques for data control after access permissions are granted. Thus, the data exchange leaves patients at the risk of privacy breaches and institutions are exposed to punitive measures when protected health information in their care is compromised. Blockchain technology presents mechanisms to secure patients' data using cryptographically secure techniques with game\u2010theoretic models of behavior control. This chapter focuses on three paradigms of data sharing and ends with an exposition on some exceptional cases where the application of blockchain in medical data sharing has valuable contributions.",

        "abstract": "As the COVID-19 continues to spread globally, more and more companies are transforming into remote online offices, leading to the expansion of electronic signatures. However, the existing electronic signatures platform has the problem of data-centered management. The system is subject to data loss, tampering, and leakage when an attack from outside or inside occurs. In response to the above problems, this paper designs an electronic signature solution and implements a prototype system based on the consortium blockchain. The solution divides the contract signing process into four states: contract upload, initiation signing, verification signing, and confirm signing. The signing process is mapped with the blockchain-linked data. Users initiate the signature transaction by signing the uploaded contract's hash. The sign state transition is triggered when the transaction is uploaded to the blockchain under the consensus mechanism and the smart contract control, which effectively ensures the integrity of the electronic contract and the non-repudiation of the electronic signature. Finally, the blockchain performance test shows that the system can be applied to the business scenario of contract signing.",

The slower the progress of consensus, the lower the throughput. To solve this problem, this paper uses PSO execution algorithm to fuse SGslice and blockchain, and designs a block chain node information fusion mechanism algorithm based on 5g. The experimental results show that the fusion algorithm greatly improves the communication efficiency of each node of the blockchain, so that the blockchain can not affect the communication speed between nodes while increasing the number of nodes, so as to greatly improve the security of the blockchain and make it better applied in various scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Clients of permissionless blockchain systems, like Bitcoin, rely on an underlying peer-to-peer network to send and receive transactions. It is critical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise the client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the blockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably distinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the attacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes business decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In this paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for Bitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing. Each approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection time and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious block timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their natural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard web activity) to gossip about their blockchain views with other clients through contacted servers. Our proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures without introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin protocol and network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the gossip-based schemes through real-world implementation. The results of our experiments indicate that the protocol incurs a negligible overhead, detects eclipse attacks rapidly with high probability, and is well-suited for practical deployment.",

        "abstract": "The concept of peer-to-peer energy trading became popular with the increase of local energy production and use of renewable energies. Based on a sharing economy, this framework allows energy trading between households, bringing flexibility and decreasing the dependency on energy providers. In parallel, the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and the development of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology open new ways to store, transport and deliver renewable energy. V2G-enabled cars could contribute to the flexibility of peer-to-peer energy marketplaces. Our physical demonstrator illustrates the benefits of V2G-enabled vehicles in the context of local energy marketplaces in terms of economical gain, overall power balancing and consumed renewable energy rate. The demonstrator is composed of smart contracts implementing such marketplace running on a local Ethereum blockchain deployed on Raspberry Pis, autonomous agents simulating the energy consumption and production behavior of 4 households as well as their buying/selling behavior, and finally a V2G car whose behavior is controlled by a user through a tablet.",

        "abstract": "IoT devices produce a lot of valuable and sensitive data that is often shared with external parties to provide different kinds of useful services. Traditional IoT access control systems are centralized and do not include all the stakeholders in the access control decision making process. To fill this gap, we propose a permissioned blockchain based access control system for IoT where a different phase of access control like creating access policy and making the access control decision happens based on the consensus of all the stakeholders. To be more specific, we design and implement Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in a permissioned blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric and leverage its smartcontract and distributed consensus to enable a distributed access control for IoT. The effectiveness of our proposed system is demonstrated by the performance evaluation result in an IoT testbed.",

This paper proposes \u201cAI pedigree verification platform\u201d to verify \u201cwhat kind of data is used to train the AI model at hand\u201d. Building such the system using an existing database system is problematic in terms of system availability and integrity of the registration content. Therefore, we constructed the proposed system using Hyperledger Fabric (HF), which is a blockchain infrastructure. In this way, the proposed system can ensure the availability of the system and the integrity of the registration content. To ensure the reproducibility of the AI model, the data items in the system were created based on the \u201cReproducibility list\u201d proposed by authoritative society for AI. Since the integrity and reproducibility of the data in the blockchain can be ensured, this system enables automatic AI model generation using open data and automatic trading of AI models.",

        "abstract": "Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications. In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction exe-cution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and spe-cial commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we eval-uated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.",

        "abstract": "Cross-heterogeneous blockchain interactions have been attracting much attention due to their application in depository blockchains mutual access and cross-blockchain identity authentication. Trusted access across heterogeneous chains is gradually becoming a hot challenge. In order to ensure cross-blockchain trusted access, the majority of the current works focus on on-chain notaries and the relay chain model. However, these methods have the following drawbacks: 1) notaries on the chain are more vulnerable to attacks due to their high degree of centralization, which causes off-chain users to lose their trust and thus exacerbates the off-chain trust crisis; 2) although the relay model involves multiple parties in maintenance and supervision and enjoys a more robust trust, the paticipatant nodes are relatively fixed, which impose a terrible dilemma that invalid nodes cannot participate in consensus formation in a timely manner, thus progressively disrupting the connectivity of the relay across heterogeneous chains and eventually reducing the rate of trusted mutual access. In this article, we propose a novel general framework for cross-heterogeneous blockchain communication based on a periodical committee rotation mechanism to support information exchange of diverse transactions across multiple heterogeneous blockchain systems. Connecting heterogeneous blockchains through committees has a more robust trust than the notary method. In order to eliminate the impact of downtime nodes in a timely manner, we periodically reorganize the committee and give priority to replacing downed nodes to ensure the reliability of the system. In addition, a message-oriented verification mechanism is designed to improve the rate of trusted intervisit across heterogeneous chains. We have built a prototype of the scheme and conducted simulation experiments on the current mainstream blockchain for message exchange across heterogeneous chains. The results show that our solution has a good perfo...",

In this paper, we propose a new transaction processing mechanism, called Accelerator, which improves the performance of blockchain-based IoT applications in terms of transaction throughput and latency. Two key design ideas of Accelerator lie in: (i) independent modular structure that can be implemented without changing the incumbent blockchain network and (ii) adaptive multi-batch scheduling engine for robust performance. We first provide a mathematical analysis that is used to choose the parameters of Accelerator to maximize the performance. Moreover, we implement Accelerator on a decentralized blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric and perform the extensive test using Hyperledger Caliper. We show that Accelerator achieves 8x transaction throughput improvement without sacrificing latency.",

        "abstract": "Development of large-scale and complex software systems requires multiple teams, including software development teams, domain experts, user representatives, and other project stakeholders, to work collaboratively to achieve software development goals. These teams rely on the use of agreed software development processes, knowledge management tools, and communication channels collaboratively in the software development project. Software testing is an important and complicated process due to reasons such as difficulties in achieving testing goals with the given time constraint, absence of efficient data sharing policies, vague testing acceptance criteria at various levels of testing, and lack of trusted coordination among the teams involved in software testing. The efficiency of the software testing relies on efficient, reliable, and trusted information sharing among these teams. Existing approaches to software testing for collaborative software development use centralized or decentralize tools for software testing, knowledge management, and communication channels. Existing approaches have the limitations of centralized authority, a single point of failure/compromise, lack of automatic requirement compliance checking and transparency in information sharing, and lack of unified data sharing policy, and reliable knowledge management repositories for sharing and storing past software testing artifacts and data. In this paper, a software testing approach for collaborative software development using private blockchain is presented, and the desirable properties of private blockchain, such as distributed data management, tamper-resistance, auditability and automatic requirement compliance checking, are incorporated to greatly improve the quality of software testing for collaborative software development.",

        "abstract": "In permissioned blockchains, a set of identifiable miners are in charge of consolidating the new blocks. The agreement protocol is usually based on a consensus mechanism inspired by a voting Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism rather than the well-known proof-of-work (PoW). However, PoW provides some benefits with respect to BFT, i.e., it allows the final user to quantify the effort required to change a consolidated transaction without the need of trusting the consortium of miners. In this paper, we address some of the problems that arise from the application of PoW in permissioned blockchains. In fact, in standard PoW, it may be easy for one miner to temporary reach 50% of the total hash power and since mining rewards are usually not expected, the problem of balancing the efforts of the miner becomes crucial. We propose a simple solution based on a sliding window algorithm to address these problems and analyse its effectiveness in terms of security. Additionally, we propose a quantitative model whose solution allows us to assess its capacity of balancing the hash power provided by heterogeneous miners.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative shipping refers to multiple independent shippers consolidating their freight flows to share the same set of carriers for goods transportation, in order to reduce cost. In this paper, we design a collaborative shipping marketplace for spot shipments, where the shipping demands are bundled dynamically without premeditated planning by the shippers. Collaborative shipping requires a neutral third party as an orchestrator, who identifies the bundling opportunities, matches with the carrier, and allocates the cost among the shippers. We propose a Blockchain based application that enables decentralized and transparent participation of shippers and carriers in choosing the matching of bundled demand with supply, without an orchestrator. A multi-disciplinary approach with techniques from multi criteria optimization, group decision making, cooperative game theory, and electoral voting are used to develop the distributed collaborative shipping application using Blockchain.",

However, current examination protocols require full trust in the operating organizations, which allows malicious organizations to cheat. As a countermeasure, efforts are being made to develop examination protocols that do not need a trusted authority. One way to build such a decentralized protocol is to apply blockchain. Several blockchain-based examination protocols have been proposed, but they can only handle a finite set of correct answers. We propose an examination protocol that can handle a set of correct answers defined by a program and mathematically guarantee the validity of the protocol. We also implement a programming contest platform based on the proposed method on Ethereum and show the feasibility of the method. Furthermore, we measure the economic cost of the method using the implementation and confirm that the method is feasible for approximately 30\u201340 USD.",

        "abstract": "Anonymous authentication is an important factor for Internet of Things (loT) applications such as Smart Grids and Vehicle Ad hoc Networks. The zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is one of the popular methods that has been used for transacting anonymously in public blockchains. However, a heavy computational process is involved during the generation of zk-SNARK proofs (zk-SNARKs). This intensive computation is a significant barrier that prevents resource-constrained loT devices from implementing zk-SNARKs for anonymous transactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a public blockchain-based lightweight anonymous authentication platform for low-power loT devices using zk-SNARKs. A lightweight anonymous authentication protocol is designed using the SHA256 hash function. The heavy proving processes of the zk-SNARK protocol are offloaded to a powerful loT machine. A proof of concept has been designed to verify the proposed platform is capable to provide anonymous authentication with the help of zk-SNARKs and InterPlanetary File System. The security of the proposed platform is analysed and has been proved to be resistant to tracking, replay, key disclosure, and desynchronization attacks. The performance of the proposed platform is also evaluated and has been proven to be supported by low-power loT devices.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin's notable success at operating autonomously as a global peer-to-peer network opened the door to a new revolutionary class of distributed systems: blockchain. However, with the rising popularity of this new paradigm, the concept of blockchain shifted greatly to the point where many systems marketed as \"blockchain\" without sharing the key components introduced by Bitcoin. It has therefore become quite challenging for system designers or decision-makers to achieve a sufficient understanding of different types of existing blockchains or to design and adopt the correct blockchain solution. To overcome this problem, we propose DCEA a holistic reference model for conceptualizing and closely examining blockchains and globally distributed ledger technologies (DLT) using a layer-wise framework that envisions all these systems as constructed of four layers: the data, consensus, execution and application layers.",

The patient data is the main concern to be noticed in healthcare analytics solutions. The privacy of data leads to securing the data with high quality of care and requires a best design methodology. In current scenario, many failed to provide security of data which stored in server accessible by third party. To improve the data security and privacy thereby reducing bandwidth and improving efficiency, a consortium method called Enhanced Proof of Work (E-PoW) consensus blockchain for IoT based healthcare monitoring system has been proposed.",

        "abstract": "Private blockchain networks are used by enterprises to manage decentralized processes without trusted mediators and without exposing their assets publicly on an open network like Ethereum. Yet external parties that cannot join such networks may have a compelling need to be informed about certain data items on their shared ledgers along with certifications of data authenticity; e.g., a mortgage bank may need to know about the sale of a mortgaged property from a network managing property deeds. These parties are willing to compensate the networks in exchange for privately sharing information with proof of authenticity and authorization for external use. We have devised a novel and cryptographically secure protocol to effect a fair exchange between rational network members and information recipients using a public blockchain and atomic swap techniques. Using our protocol, any member of a private blockchain can atomically reveal private blockchain data with proofs in exchange for a monetary reward to an external party if and only if the external party is a valid recipient. The protocol preserves confidentiality of data for the recipient, and in addition, allows it to mount a challenge if the data turns out to be inauthentic. We also formally analyze the security and privacy of this protocol, which can be used in a wide array of practical scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In general, applications use Trusted Third Party to authenticate users, application servers, and devices. Since Trusted Third Party based solutions are centralized, a decentralized scheme is preferred for applications, and blockchain is one of the best solutions for decentralization. Hence, this paper proposes a trust score based decentralized authentication model using the blockchain technology for dynamic networks. In our proposed model, any device can join the network at any time through existing nodes by sending the join transaction to the blockchain. A new device in the network can do messaging with other existing devices; however, the receiving device may not accept until the sender gains a full trust score in the network. The trust score of nodes is built based on its behavior and contributions to the network viz. mining, voting, introducing new node, and fact creation. The proposed model does not give incentives to the miners in the form of currency. At the same time, it should support the network, which is public, dynamic, and untrusted. Hence, we introduce a private and public nodes based blockchain model with incentives such as subsidy, green corridor, etc. We analyze the proposed model for security effectiveness, resource usage, communication overhead, and computational performance to prove lightweight devices' applicability.",

        "abstract": "In cryptocurrencies, transaction fees are typically exclusively paid in the native platform currency. This restriction causes a wide range of challenges, such as deteriorated user experience, mandatory rent payments by decentralized applications, and blockchain community rivalries (e.g., coinism). Ideally, in a truly permissionless blockchain, transaction fees should be payable in any other cryptocurrency via so-called metatransactions. In this paper, we formalize metatransactions, review existing ideas, and describe novel metatransaction design approaches. Under the assumption of sufficient market liquidity, we argue that meta-transactions do not lower the security of cryptocurrency platforms. However, without changing the underlying blockchain, metatransaction designs typically increase transaction costs and reduce the blockchain transaction throughput.",

        "abstract": "Partitioning attacks on blockchain systems are a serious threat, with the potential to cause significant harm on the individual level and to the system as a whole. Deliberate partitions can be used by attackers to defraud merchants using crypto-currencies and enrich themselves, while natural disasters and wars could disrupt blockchain systems for months, potentially destroying them entirely. Unfortunately, the exact effects of these partitions at large scale are unknown and difficult to model, making it challenging to implement preventative measures or plan for partition recovery. In this work, we examine a variety of real-world global scale partitioning events to develop a framework for categorizing and analyzing different partition types. We use this framework, along with a new metric introduced to finely measure the global coherence of a given blockchain, to quantify the impacts of soft and hard network partitions at varying scales. Our goal is to lay the groundwork for the introduction of new blockchain architectures to minimize the harm caused during partitions and facilitate rapid and uncontroversial recovery from them.",
